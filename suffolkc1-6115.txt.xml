Summary
An archaeological excavation was carried out in advance of a new access control area at Gate 2,
Lord's Walk, RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk. In total, an area of 4058 sqm was excavated and this
revealed four main phases of activity.
The first phase was a large, discrete, cluster of 22 pits, dating from the Late Neolithic/Early
Bronze Age. The majority of these pits were uniformly filled with large quantities of Beaker
pottery sherds, worked flints and deposits of charcoal. A second phase of limited occupation in
the Iron Age period, with three large pits, was followed by a third Late Iron Age/Early Roman
phase, consisting of a trackway and an associated network of ditches. This is a continuation of
the field system identified at ERL 089, 200m to the east, and can probably be associated with the
nearby settlement at Caudle Head mere.
The southern ditch of the trackway has a definite kink in its course, avoiding the phase I pit
group, indicating that some trace of these features may st have been visible. In general the line
of the trackway corresponds closely with the course of the modern Lords Walk road, implying
that this is an ancient route to move livestock between winter pasture on the heathland to the
east, and summer pasture to the west on the fen-edge. A final fourth phase of activity is formed
by a small group of mostly post-medieval metallic objects recovered from a small spread of
subsoil by metal detecting. A range of miscellaneous undated pits and ditches were scattered
across the site and are most likely to be contemporary with phases I to III.

1. Introduction
An archaeological excavation was carried out in advance of a new access control area at Gate 2,
Lord's Walk, RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk. Normal planning procedures had been bypassed for this
urgent development but the site was deemed to be of archaeological interest due to its proximity
to various known archaeological sites within RAF Lakenheath and a full excavation was
requested by Judith Plouviez (Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service, Conservation
Team). The work was carried out at very short notice with extreme time constraints and was
funded by the developer, MoD Defence Estates (USF).
RAF Lakenheath lies between the eastern edge of the fens and the western margins of Breckland
and the site lies just outside the perimeter fence on the south-west side of the airbase, at TL 7237
7996 (Fig. 1) in Eriswell parish. The site lay on an area of undeveloped grassland and was
relatively flat, with a very gentle west-facing slope heading down towards the fens, from 12m
OD at the eastern end of the site to 8.5m OD at the west. The edge of the fens, as seen on a 1946
aerial photograph (Caruth 2003), was approximately 180m away, although the current `cut-off'
channel is now 500m to the west.
At the time of the excavation no previous work had been done at the site and its potential was
largely unknown, in particular it had not been possible to evaluate the area due to the urgency of
the development. However the airbase is an area rich in archaeological deposits of all periods
and has seen a high level of previous archaeological work. It was therefore expected that the
development of the site would disturb archaeological deposits, due to its location in relation to
surrounding known sites (Fig.2).
Evidence of settlement and burial activity, from the Iron Age to Anglo-Saxon periods, has been
identified throughout the vicinity of ERL 120. A kilometre to the north-east lies a Late Iron
Age/Roman settlement around a natural spring at Caudle Head mere and three large Anglo-
Saxon cemeteries have been excavated 750m north-east of the site. Further traces of Roman
occupation extending southwards from Caudle Head have been found in various archaeological
monitorings (ERL 111, 112, 117 and 118) while Roman finds have been found at ERL 022 to the
north-east and ERL 006 and 0054 to the south of the site. At a recent excavation (ERL 089),
some 200m to the east of the site, a Middle Iron Age enclosure and a Late Iron Age/Early Roman
trackway and field system has been identified (Caruth 2003).
The site therefore lay in an area with strong potential for the prescence of multi-period
archaeological deposits, being within 200 metres of known Iron Age and Roman activity.
Excavation offered an opportunity to see if this occupation extended further to the west and to
look for other phases of activity.
2. Methodology
In total, an area of 4058 sqm was stripped of topsoil to the top of the archaeological levels by two mechanical
excavators with 2m ditching buckets under the supervision of an archaeologist. This revealed the natural subsoil, a
mix of yellow/orange sands and gravels, at a depth of 0.3 ­ 0.4m.
Due to time restrictions only a minimum of cleaning of archaeological soil layers and a limited metal detecting
survey was possible. However most archaeological features were clearly visible after machining and were excavated
by hand, generally 50% of pits and postholes although certain features were 100% excavated and sieved. Sections of
ditches were placed to define stratigraphic relationships. Bulk soil samples were taken from a selection of contexts.
The site was laid out on a 20m grid using an alpha-numeric reference and planned using a Total Station Theodolite.
A single context continuous numbering system was used and feature sections and soil profiles were drawn at a scale
of 1:20. Colour slide and black and white print photographs were taken of all stages of the excavation.

3. Results
(Fig. 3)
3.1. General
Removal of the 0.30-0.40m of topsoil directly uncovered the natural subsoil of mid
yellow/brown sand and gravels in which the archaeological features were generally clearly
visible, the site as a whole was relatively undisturbed and the archaeology well preserved. The
excavation uncovered a low-density spread of features across the site, and these can be divided at
a glance at their spatial characteristics into four broad categories. There is a large cluster of pits
to the east, a network of east-west and north-south aligned ditches across the site, a small group
of pits to the west and a general scatter of miscellaneous features across the site. Dating the
features is problematic however, with only a small proportion of features yielding any datable
evidence, and stratigraphic evidence is either non-existent or unclear. However with the
available dating evidence and comparison with the nearby site ERL 089 it is possible to divide
the features into three main phases, with the remainder being unphased. These phases generally
correspond with the spatial groups given above. Phase I consists of the main cluster of pits
(0162) and three other scattered features, these are of a Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age date.
Phase II consists of the small cluster of pits which are predominantly Iron Age. Phase III consists
of the ditch network, this is composed of a Late Iron Age/Early Roman field system and a later
system on a slightly different alignment. The unphased features are predominately the
miscellaneous features that are scattered across the site. A final fourth phase has been given to
the cluster of small finds, mostly post-medieval metallic objects from a subsoil spread (0189),
that were uncovered by metal detecting.
3.2. Phase I: Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age
(Figs. 4, 5 and 6)
Features of this phase mainly occur in a cluster of pits (0162) and this cluster accounts for the
vast majority of finds recovered from the entire site. The cluster consists of seventeen pits, all of
which had very similar form and f characteristics. The fills were uniformly similar, with dense
quantities of charcoal containing hazel nutshell, burnt bone fragments and Beaker pottery sherds.
This suggests that the pits were all open and filled simultaneously from a common source.
Eleven of these seventeen pits contained Early Bronze Age pottery. Fifteen also contained
worked flint that appears to be contemporary with the pottery.
A further five small pits lay nearby to the north-west (0221, 0223, 0227, 0229 and 0233) and two
of these (0223 and 0227) also contained Early Bronze Age material. The appearance of these pits
was somewhat different to those in 0162, they are less well defined, loosely scattered and lack
the dense charcoal fills of the pits in the 0162 group.
Three more pits (0004, 0069 and 0116) which are scattered across the site also contained Early
Bronze Age pottery. 0004 is a sizeable feature and lies within another small group of features
which also contain Iron Age material. The other two pits, 0069 and 0116 are isolated features but
0116 contained a sizeable assemblage of struck flint.

3.3. Phase II: Iron Age
(Figs. 4 and 7)
This phase of activity consisted of three pits in a loose grouping in the north-west part of the site
and a nearby ditch. The three pits 0008, 0030 and 0074 were all sizeable features and
undisturbed, as was ditch 0002. Pit 0008 contained pottery from the Bronze Age, Iron Age and
Medieval periods but as the Iron Age material came from a sealed basal deposit it appears to date
to this phase.
0002 was a north-south aligned ditch with vertical sides and a flat base. It had two fills; 0003
being a mid brown sand, becoming lighter and more orange towards the base of the ditch and
0019, a mid-dark brown sand with some charcoal and Iron Age pottery sherds.
0008 was a circular pit, with fairly steep sides and a curved base, measuring 1.75m wide, 1.9m
long and 0.9m deep. Its main fill, 0009, was a mid brown/grey sand with a light grey sand band
running through the base. A black sand/charcoal layer, 0014, contained some pottery sherds.
Another black sand/charcoal layer at the top also contained some pottery. It was 50% excavated.
0030/0088 was a possible pit under the north edge of the site. It measured 1.8m wide and 0.6m
deep and appeared to be circular with gently sloping sides and a curved base. Its fill, 0031/0089,
was a mid-dark grey/brown sand containing pottery sherds and was 50% excavated.
0074 was a large, circular pit, measuring 2m wide and 0.80m deep. It was filled with banded
layers of pale brown and silver/grey sands and was 50% excavated. The upper fill, 0075, was a
thin layer of dark grey, charcoal-rich sand lying above the main fill, 0076, a silver/grey fine
sand, both of which contained pottery sherds.

Although the majority of the ditches on the site contained no datable evidence it is believed that
they form part of a Late Iron Age/Early Roman field system (phase IIIa) which is apparent at
other locations nearby (ERL 089 and ERL 112). Many of the ditches follow a particular grid
alignment with two west-east ditches, 0057 and 0082, running parallel to each other through the
site, with several north-south ditches crossing between the two. Ditch 0002, although it has been
placed in Phase II, is on the same alignment as the north-south ditches on the site, implying that
it may actually be a part of the Late Iron Age/Early Roman ditch system with Iron Age pottery in
its f being residual.
One ditch, 0207, contained Roman material and with 0209, 0211 and 0064 forms a ditch system
(phase IIIb) on a slightly different alignment to that seen in phase IIIa. As 0064 cuts 0057 they
appear to represent a later Roman field system.
<Node id="24377"/>The lack of material recovered from these ditches<Node id="24426"/> may be partly due to the fact that only limited
excavation was possible, principally of ditch intersections in an attempt to establish
relationships, due to time constraints. Only about 5% of the length of these ditches was
excavated, in comparison to a more usual 10-20% and this w have affected the quantity of
dating material recovered.
Phase IIIa (Late Iron Age/Early Roman)
(Figs. 8 and 9)
0057 was an east-west aligned ditch running across the site. At its west end it cornered and
headed south, splitting into three recuts, 0049, 0051 and 0055, with dark grey/brown sand fills,
0050, 0052 and 0056 respectively. A series of sections (0063, 0065/0066, 0083, 0087, 0093,
0118, 0133 and 0160) were excavated to establish relationships with other features and the fills
within these sections varied from pale grey/brown sand to mid brown sand. The ditch cuts
features 0061, 0072, 0130, 0134, 0136, 0138 and 0147, is cut by 0064 and 0077, and has unclear
relationships with 0053, 0079, 0081, 0124, 0125 and 0152.
0077 was a narrow, north-south aligned, ditch., butt-ending just north of the south edge of the
site. It had a steep-sided, V-shaped profile and measured 0.4-5m wide and 0.3m deep. It had a
mid grey/brown sand fill, seen in sections 0078, 0093 and 0198. It cut ditch 0057, was cut by
0082, and met 0098 at the north edge of the site but the relationship between the two was
unclear.
0079 was a ditch aligned south-north across the site from ditch 0082 to the southern edge. It had
a mid-pale brown sand fill, seen in sections 0083, 0084, 0086, 0096 and 0197. Its relationships
with 0057, 0080, 0081 and 0082 were unclear.
0080 was a small ditch splitting from 0079 and running north parallel to it. It butt-ended on the
north side of 0082 which it was probably cut by. It had a pale brown sand fill, seen in sections
0086 and 0096.
0081 was a small ditch splitting from 0079 and butt-ending 4 metres to the north. It had an
unclear relationship with 0079 and 0057, seen in sections 0083 and 0084.
0082 was a ditch, aligned east-west, parallel to 0057. In sections 0092 and 0096 it had a pale
brown sand f and cut features 0077 and 0109, had an unclear relationship with ditch 0079 and
12
probably cut 0080. At its east end it split into two cuts, 0150 and 0151, which appeared to join
ditches 0124 and 0125, seen in sections 0149 and 0240.
0098 was a narrow, shallow ditch, aligned east-west, just north of and parallel to ditch 0082. It
emerged from the north edge of the site at its intersection with 0077, the relationship being
unclear, and butt ended to the east. It had a pale brown, stoney/sand fill.
0124 was a north-south aligned ditch, adjacent to and parallel with ditch 0125 at the east end of
the site. To the north it joined ditch 0150. To the south it merged with 0125 into a single ditch,
0140, just before the junction with ditch 0057, and may be continuing south as 0134. Its
relationship with 0057 was unclear. Its fill, seen in sections 0127 and 0240 was a light brown
silt/sand with occasional small stones.
0125 was a ditch, east of and parallel to 0124. It joined 0151 to north, and to the south it merged
with 0124 before possibly continuing as 0138 to the south of 0057. It had an nnclear relationship
with 0057. Its fill, seen in sections 0127 and 0149, was a light brown silt/sand with occasional
small stones.
0130 was a north-south aligned ditch at the east end of the site. It had shallow, gently sloping
sides and a flat base and a mid grey/brown sand fill. On the surface it appeared to be cut by
0057.
0136 was a north-south aligned ditch, parallel to 0124 and 0125. It cut posthole 0156 and 0150
and but was cut by 0151 and then 0057 at its southern end. Its fill, a mid brown sand was seen in
sections 0137, 0142 and 0240.
0152 was a slightly curving ditch aligned north-south. It ran from the south edge of the site, west
of and parallel to 0154. It measured 1m wide and 0.3m deep and had a f of mid brown silt/sand
with occasional small stones seen in sections 0153 and 0161. It merged into 0057 but the
relationship was unclear.
0154 was a small, shallow, slightly curving ditch, aligned north-south. It ran from the south edge
of the site for approximately 7m before butt-ending and was east of, and parallel to, ditch 0152.
It had a f of mixed mid and light brown silty sands.

Phase IIIb (Roman)
(Figs. 8 and 10)
0064 was a broad, north-south aligned, ditch. It measured approximately 1.6m wide and had a
mid brown sand f with bands of iron pan, seen in sections 0192 and 0065. It was cut by 0203
and 0205, had an unclear relationship with 0207 and cut through 0057 before butt-ending to the
north. It may be a later feature than the other ditches in this phase as the presence of iron panning
suggests a wetter environment, which is generally seen in the surrounding area in the post-
Roman period.
0207, 0209 and 0211 were three, east-west aligned ditches, which ran west from under layer
0189 into 0064. They appeared as a single feature on the surface, and had a brown silt/sand fill
with some pebbles, 0208, 0210 and 0212 respectively.
Figure 10. Phase IIIb sections
3.5. Phase IV: Post Medieval
In the southwest corner of the site a spread of soil (0189) survived, overlying the subsoil and
ditches 0207, 0209 and 0211. The spread was 0.15m thick, probably being the f of a natural
hollow, and contained several metallic small finds of post-medieval date which were found by
metal detecting. No section was recorded.
3.6. Unphased
(Figs. 11, 12 and 13)
As previously noted many features contained no dating evidence, and do not fit any pattern of
distribution and hence are unphased. These are generally isolated scattered pits and postholes
occurring throughout the site, of which there are 40 (Fig. 13). Some of these pits may, 0102,
0114 and 0145 in particular, simply be natural features, such as hollows in the undulating subsoil
or treeholes. A few have either defined or unclear stratigraphic relationships with features from
other phases.

middle and mid brown sand at the base. It was 50% excavated.
0043 was a small circular pit, 0.5m wide, 0.35m long and 0.14m deep with gently sloping sides
and a curved base. The fill, 0044, was a slightly darker brown sand than the surrounding natural
and was 50% excavated.
0045 was an oval, irregular pit, aligned west-east, measuring 0.7m wide, 1.5m long and 0.37m
deep. It had a fill, 0046, of mid grey and dark grey sand and was 50% excavated.

It measured 0.3m in diameter and 0.2m deep with a circular cut, quite steep sides and a slightly
curved base and was 50% excavated. Its fill, 0054, was a dark grey/brown sand with occasional
stones, similar to that of the adjacent ditches.
16

stones.
0090 was a small, circular posthole with a concave base, 0.2m in diameter and 0.12m deep. Its
fill, 0091, was a dark brown/black sand with charcoal and was 50% excavated .
0094 was a large circular pit with a mid-pale brown sand/gravel fill, 0095. The f contained
layers of iron panning and a thin horizon of charcoal at the base.
0102 was a small, irregular pit, filled with pale brown sand, 0103, and was possibly a natural
feature.
0106 was a small, very shallow, circular posthole, 0.4m in diameter and 0.06m deep. Its fill,
0107, was a dark grey sand and charcoal. No section was recorded.
0108 was a shallow, rectangular posthole/pit just north of the butt-end of 0103. It was 0.35m
wide, 0.5m long and 0.1m deep with a fill, 0109, of dark brown sand.
0109 was a small, charcoal filled, pit or posthole, cut by the southern edge of ditch 0082.

sand/charcoal.
0112 was a shallow, bowl-shaped, pit measuring 1m in diameter and 0.25m deep. It had a dark
brown sand fill, 0113, with some gravel.
0114 was an irregular feature, 0.45m wide and 0.4m deep with a dark, charcoal-flecked sand fill.
It was probably a natural feature and no section was recorded.
0115 was a shallow, bowl-shaped, feature alongside 0114. It had a single f of pale brown,
stony sand.
0121 was a steep-sided, concave-based, pit, measuring 0.6m wide, 0.7m long and 0.35m deep. It
had a dark grey/black sand fill, 0122.
0123 was a large, circular, shallow pit, 1.6m wide, 1.36m long and 0.14m deep. It had a mid
grey/brown sand fill, 0126.
0145 was a very shallow, oval feature, 0.3m wide, 1.2m long and 0.1m deep with a dark brown

by Sarah Percival
Introduction
Excavation at site ERL 120 produced 455 sherds of prehistoric pottery weighing 5449g (7 sherds
(32g) from 0186 are not included in this report). The majority of the sherds were of Later
Neolithic/Early Bronze Age Beaker (432 sherds, 5275g). A small number of Bronze Age, Iron
Age and undatable prehistoric sherds were also found (see Table 2). The sherds were generally
large with an average sherd weight of 12g and were mostly fresh and well preserved. A number
of partially complete vessels were represented but <Node id="40120"/>the assemblage contained no complete pots<Node id="40161"/>.

Methodology
The assemblage was analysed using the pottery recording system described in the Norfolk Archaeological Unit
Pottery Recording Manual and in accordance with the Guidelines for analysis and publication laid down by the
Prehistoric Ceramic Research Group (PCRG 1992). The total assemblage was studied and a full catalogue was
prepared. The sherds were examined using a binocular microscope (x10 magnification) and were divided into fabric
groups defined on the basis of inclusion types present. Fabric codes were prefixed by a letter code representing the
main inclusion present (F representing flint, G grog and Q quartz). Vessel form was recorded; R representing rim
sherds, B base sherds, D decorated sherds and U undecorated body sherds. The sherds were counted and weighed to
the nearest whole gram. Decoration and abrasion were also noted.
Later Neolithic/Early Bronze Age
The Beaker assemblage is large and well preserved. A total of 432 sherds (5275g) were
identified as being Beaker, mostly on the basis of decoration but also by distinctive form and
fabric. The majority of the assemblage came from a group of 17 pits (0162), which between
21
them contained 425 sherds (5265g) representing over eighty vessels. The assemblage probably
represents domestic pottery and dates to 2600-1800BC (Healy 1996, 114).
Fabric
The Later Neolithic/Early Bronze Age pottery was characterised by a soft fabric with buff-
orange to buff-brown colouring. Five fabrics were identified from two main fabric groups. Grog
tempered fabrics made up the most of the assemblage (79.21%, 4251g). Three grog-rich fabrics
were identified, one containing grog with quartz-sand (G1), the second containing grog with
burnt flint (G2) and a third containing only large pieces of grog (G3). The second group of
fabrics contained crushed burnt flint temper and were divided into two sub groups, the first
containing flint and quartz-sand (F1) the second slightly coarse fabric containing just flint (F2).
Flint tempered fabrics made up around 20% of the assemblage (1118g). A small number of
sherds were too small to be assigned a fabric group and were therefore unclassified (U, 0.13%,
7g). Quantities and weights of sherds by fabric are summarised in Table 3 below. Full fabric
descriptions are in the archive.

The range of fabrics presented is compatible with Later Neolithic/Early Bronze Age fabrics
found throughout East Anglia and beyond (Healy 1988, fig.78). No obvious link was observed
between fabric and decorative style though fingertip impressed and `plastic rusticated'
decoration was slightly more common in the coarser flint-tempered fabrics. This may suggest
that choice of fabric was influenced by the function of the pot, as it is possible that the rusticated
vessel may have represented the coarser element of the domestic assemblage.
Form and decoration
A minimum of ninety-five vessels is represented within the assemblage but no fully
reconstructable profiles were found. The Beakers are characterised by long upright necks and
simple rounded flattened or pointed rims. This suggests a `W' shaped profile for the majority of
the Beakers. A single vessel with an inverted rim and neck forming a slightly closed profile is
also present. Three examples have marked changes of angle on the shoulder of the vessel; all are
decorated with fingertip and fingernail impressions. One vessel has a pronounced globular
profile. Three sherds have pierced holes drilled through the vessel walls when the pot was semi-
dry or leather-hard, before it had been fired. Two of the pierced sherds are from the upper part of
the pot with the hole being placed a short distance down the neck of the Beaker below the rim.
The third example appears to be on the body of the vessel.
A wide range of decorative techniques was employed. These are summarised in Table 4. The
assemblage contains a mixture of vessels. The heavier, more coarse vessels are decorated with
plastic rustication comprised of fingertip and fingernail impressions (FTI, FNI). These appear to
cover the entire body of the pots, often with two or three horizontal bands around the girth of the
pot with vertical bands or cable formed from double or pinched fingertip impressions below. The
more finely made vessels are comb-impressed or tool-impressed. Both `open' designs in the
form of continuous filled horizontal bands and `closed designs' of floating lozenges and triangles
are present. Tool-impressed circles appear on two vessels where they cover the entire body of the
22
Beaker. The circles are both small, formed from a single worked bone or other tool, or larger,
formed from a curved tool used several times to form a complete circle.

Deposition
Beaker pottery was in the fills of pits (Table 5). Over ninety-eight percent (5265g) of the Beaker
assemblage came from a group of seventeen pits, group number 0162. Beaker was also found in
small quantities in two other pits. The assemblage is characterised as domestic as it is
fragmentary, and contains a combination of plastic rusticated styles and more complex impressed
styles commonly found on domestic sites in East Anglia (Gibson 1982; Bamford 1982). The
placement of highly decorated Beaker sherds within isolated pits is a phenomenon observed on
several Later Neolithic Early Bronze Age sites (Ashwin 1998, 25; Ashwin 2001, 28) though the
majority of domestic Beaker was probably deposited in surface middens. The nature of pit
deposits has been suggested as representing a blurring between ritual practice, perhaps in the
form of special deposits, and the domestic or mundane, that is the utilitarian pottery (Ashwin
2001, 28).

Dating and Affinities
Beaker currency spanned the period of approximately 2600 and 1800BC (Kinnes et al. 1992,
Healy 1996, table 13). The Beaker assemblage shows a wide range of styles and decorative
techniques including complex closed motifs and fingertip plastic rustication which typify later
Beaker styles found on sites such as Hockwold cum Wilton (Bamford 1982). Within East Anglia
parallels for the ERL120 assemblage can also be found at Little Bealings, Suffolk, which
produced examples of both fingertip impressed and combed lozenges and hanging triangles
(Martin 1993, Fig. 36, 9, 14, 18). At Reffley Wood, Norfolk, tool impressed circles were also
found (Gibson 1982, Fig. REF.1 No. 20). Beaker decoration appears to become more complex
through time (Boast 1995, 73) suggesting that the ERL120 assemblage probably lies towards the
later part of the Beaker currency (2600-1800BC).
Bronze Age
Eleven sherds of pottery weighing 88g were identified as being of Bronze Age date on the basis
of the distinctive tempered fabric. The Bronze Age assemblage included four undecorated body
sherds in grog-tempered fabrics (G1 and G2) and seven sherds which formed the semi-complete
base of a single vessel. The base was simple and undecorated and in a poor state of preservation.
The Bronze Age sherds were found in three contexts, the body sherds from layers (0006 and
0008) and the base from the f of a pit (0069). <Node id="48612"/>The Bronze Age sherds lack distinctive form or
decoration and therefore are not closely datable<Node id="48707"/>.
Iron Age
Nine sherds weighing 82g were identified as being Iron Age. Two fabrics were identified, one
tempered with quartz-sand (Q1 one sherd 21g) and the other with organic vegetable matter
possibly chopped grass or chaff (V1 eight sherds 61g). The sherds were all undecorated body
sherds, though the vegetable-tempered sherds were all finished with a rough wiped treatment to
the surface. The Iron Age sherds were found in four contexts, one ditch f (0002) and two pits
(0008 and 0074) and one possible pit cut (0030). All the sherds were in a fresh condition and
with the exception of those from pit 0008 were large suggesting that they were in situ.
4.2.2 Roman pottery
by Cathy Tester
One body sherd of a Roman greyware jar with a smoothed external surface and a horizontal
groove was found in 0097.
4.3 Ceramic Building Material (CBM)
A fragment of overfired and heavily vitrified brick was found in 0009. The surfaces are irregular
and it measures approximately 50mm thick. The fabric is very dense but poorly mixed and
contains sand and ferrous fragments. The date is uncertain.
4.4 Lava quern
by Cathy Tester
One piece of lava quern with a maximum thickness of 48mm was collected from 0208. The
grinding surface is smooth and the non-grinding surface is pecked.

4.5 Flint
4.5.1 Worked flint
by Sarah Bates
Methodology
Each piece of flint was examined and recorded by context in an Access database table. The material was classified
by category and type (see archive) with numbers of pieces and numbers of complete, corticated, and patinated pieces
being recorded. Additional descriptive comments were made as necessary. Retouched and utilised flints pieces have
been bagged separately within the main bags (except where context assemblages are very small). Flints selected for
possible illustration have been removed from the main context bags and bagged separately.
The assemblage
A total of 601 pieces of struck flints was recovered from the site. Most of the flint is mid to dark
grey in colour with cortex of various types. Many pieces have an off-white grey cortex,
sometimes quite thick, with areas of abraded white patina on some surfaces showing that
surface-collected lumps of flint were often used as a raw material. The inclusion of some pieces
which are clearly struck from small cores suggests that smaller gravel pebbles were also utilised.
There is little post-depositional edge damage, almost all of the flint is sharp. Much of the
debitage is irregular in nature and many of the pieces have been struck by hard hammer. The
assemblage is summarised by type in Table 6 and listed in Appendix 2.3.

Table 6. Flint by type
Thirteen cores, many quite small, are present. They include three single platform and five multi
platform flakes cores, thirteen tested/struck pieces and a fragment which may be the platform of
a shattered core. About half were already patinated prior to their use.
By far the main part of the assemblage is made up of unmodified flakes. Many flakes are
irregular and some are broad in shape. A relatively small number of spalls are present. Relatively
small numbers of blades and blade-like pieces are present and many of those classified as such
25
are in fact quite irregular in nature. Only one blade has been recorded as struck from a prepared
blade core. A number of contexts contain irregular shattered fragments
A total of 37 pieces have been classified as scrapers although many of them have only minimal
retouch ­ often around the distal ends of quite small ovate flakes. There are also a number of
subcircular scrapers, usually quite small with retouch around their distal part but extending
around other edges. Several of these could be described as `thumbnail' types which are usually
considered to be characteristic of the later Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (or Beaker) period.
Another group can be classified as side scrapers. Almost all of these are small flakes with
retouch along one side and sometimes extending slightly around the distal part.
Two pieces have been classed as piercers. These are an irregular shatter piece, one point of
which appears to have been utilised 0178 and a flake with retouch forming an irregular, possibly
`spurred' edge 0166.
One arrowhead is present 0164 (Fig.14). It is unifacially retouched along both edges to a point at
its proximal end. Its distal end is also retouched, forming an asymmetrical base to the arrowhead.
The piece can be described as an oblique type and is of later Neolithic date.
Figure 14. Arrowhead from pit f 0164
Twenty other retouched pieces are present. These include fifteen flakes, four blades and two
fragments, one thermal and one shattered fragment, both with surfaces patinated prior to their
use. One of the blades is a fine soft hammer struck piece 0164 which is probably re-used; it was
patinated prior to the retouch of its edges.
Six utilised pieces are present. They included two flakes and six blades. One soft hammer struck
with some damage to its edges may be residual.
Two hammerstones are present. One is a quite small regular round-shaped cortical patinated
lump 0186 the other is larger and more irregular 0188. Both have areas of batter on their
surfaces.
Distribution
A total of 531 struck flints was recovered from the fills of a group of features 0162 in the south
part of the site. Most of the flints are unmodified flakes, often irregular hard hammer struck
pieces and almost all sharp. There are very few blades and blade-like pieces. Many of the pits
also contained pottery although dates are not currently available.
26
The largest number of pieces (177) was from pit 0163, f 0164. Included are two small multi
platform flake cores, a core fragment, five struck/tested pieces, and four shatter pieces.
Retouched pieces include a retouched blade (possibly a re-used piece), an irregular leaf-shaped
flake, three scrapers all with minimal retouch and three other retouched flakes.
A total of 123 flints came from pit 0177, f 0178. One single and two multi platform flake cores
and two tested or struck pieces are present. Thirteen scrapers include seven end scrapers, 4
subcircular scrapers and two side scrapers. All of them, especially the subcircular examples, are
quite small. An irregular fragment may have been used as a piercer and two retouched flakes,
two retouched fragments and two utilised flakes are also present.
Eighty flints were found in pit 0183, f 0184. One squat single platform core is present. Ten
scrapers include four small subcircular pieces, three small side scrapers and three end scrapers on
`blade-like' flakes (Fig. 15). Also present are three retouched flakes and one utilised blade-like
piece.
A total of twenty-eight flints came from pit 0187 (0188, 0216, 0217 and 0218). They include a
utilised blade, a subcircular scraper and a hammerstone.
Twenty-three flints came from pit 0167, f 0168. They include one small squat side scraper.
Nineteen flints were found in pit 0179, f 0180.
Fourteen flints were found in pit 0185, f 0186. These include a struck fragment, an irregular
side scraper, two retouched flakes and a small hammerstone.
Thirteen flints came from pit 0171, f 0172. They include a small neat side scraper and a single
platform flake core.
Thirteen flints were found in pit 0181, f 0182. They include one retouched flake and one
utilised blade.
Eleven small flints, including a multi platform flake core were found in pit 0175, f 0176.
Less than ten flints came from each of the remaining features belonging to group 0162:
Pit Fill
0165 0166 1 end scraper and 1 possible spurred piece
0169 0170 1 tested piece and 6 flakes
0173 0174 1 struck fragment and 2 flakes
0219 0220 7 flakes and 1 small subcircular scraper
0190 0190 1 blade-like flake
0223 0224 2 flakes
0227 0228 1 flake
A total of 58 flints came from f 0117 of pit 0116 which also contained pottery and was located
to the north of the main pit group 0162. They included four irregular side scrapers, five
retouched flakes and unmodified debitage.
Part of a scraper and a flake were found, in ditch 0152; 0153 and a single flake in ditch 0154, fill
0155 both close to pit group 0162. Other flints were found in very small numbers (one or two
pieces) in a small number of features in the central and western parts of the site.

Discussion
The flint from the site consists mostly of hard hammer-struck material with a tendency to broad
or squat flakes and relatively small numbers of blade-like pieces. There are irregular shatter
pieces and very little evidence for core preparation. The cores which are present are mostly quite
small and irregular. Many pieces have surfaces which were already patinated prior to use. It
seems that surface-collected flint was generally used as a raw material and there are a number of
irregular pieces which have been tested for use and presumably discarded when found to be
unsuitable. The nature of the flint suggests that it is of later prehistoric date, probably late
Neolithic to Bronze Age. One or two pieces may represent the re-use of residual earlier flint.
28
A relatively large number of pieces are classified as scrapers, mostly small and in many cases
with only minimal retouch. However most of them are quite neat and several are small
subcircular pieces, some could be classified as thumbnail types which are often associated with
Beaker type pottery of later Neolithic/Early Bronze Age date (Edmonds 1995, 140). Few other
tool types are present and scrapers have been recognised as the predominant tool type associated
with Beaker assemblages (Cleal 1984, 151). The arrowhead, also of later Neolithic date, is of a
type sometimes found in association with Beaker (mainly later Beaker) assemblages (Green
1984).
Most of the flint came from the group of pits in the south part of the site many of which also
contained pottery of Beaker date. The flint is generally sharp and is probably contemporary with
the use of the pits.
4.5.2 Burnt flint/stone
Eighteen contexts produced 118 fragments of burnt flint and sandstone. The majority was
associated with pottery and/or flint of Early Bronze Age date. The largest groups were from pit
fills 0068, 0072, 0164 and 0178.
4.6 Small Finds
The following small finds were collected. All were probably post-medieval.
1001 Ae Gilded leaf, probably machine-pressed from sheet.
1002 Fe ?Handle fragment.
1003 Fe Nail.
1004 Fe Nail.
1005 Fe Cut sheet strip fragment.
1006 Fe ?Horsehoe fragment.
1007 Fe Six nails.
4.7 Biological evidence
4.7.1 Animal bone
A complete cattle metacarpal in poor condition was found in 0065.
4.7.2 Charcoal
Fragments of charcoal were collected from 0060, 0178 and 0217.
4.7.3 Plant macrofossils
by Val Fryer
Introduction
Samples for the extraction of the plant macrofossil assemblages were taken from an extensive
series of pits of Early Bronze Age to Iron Age date. Eighteen samples were submitted for
assessment.
Methods
The samples were processed by manual water flotation/washover, collecting the flots in a 500 micron mesh sieve.
The dried flots were scanned under a binocular microscope at magnifications up to ×16, and the plant macrofossils
and other remains noted are listed on Tables 7 and 8. Nomenclature within the tables follows Stace (1997). All plant
remains were preserved by charring. Modern contaminants, including fibrous roots and seeds were noted
throughout. The non-floating residues were collected in a 1mm mesh sieve and w be sorted, when dry, for the
retrieval of artefacts and ecofacts.

Results of assessment
Plant macrofossils
Cereal grains/chaff, seeds of common weed species and nutshell fragments were recovered at
varying densities from fifteen samples. Preservation was poor to moderate, with a high density of
the grains and seeds being puffed and distorted, probably due to high temperatures during
combustion.
Grains, including specimens of barley (Hordeum sp.), were moderately common in sample 0012,
although a high proportion were too severely puffed for close identification. An elongated ` drop
form' grain, probably of spelt (T. spelta) was noted in sample 0013, along with a single spelt
glume base and an oat (Avena sp.) awn fragment.
Seeds of common weed species were only noted in samples 0012 and 0013. Fat hen
(Chenopodium album) and black bindweed (Fallopia convolvulus) seeds were abundant in
sample 0012 and formed the main components of the assemblage. Other taxa noted included an
indeterminate grass (Poaceae), vetch/vetchling (Vicia/Lathyrus sp.) and possibly
medick/clover/trefoil (Medicago/Trifolium/Lotus sp.).
Hazel (Corylus avellana) nutshell fragments were abundant in sample 0172 and present in all the
samples from the Early Bronze Age pits.
Charcoal fragments were common or abundant throughout. Pieces of charred root, rhizome or
stem, including numerous fragments of heather (Ericaceae) stem, were common in samples 0012
and 0013. Indeterminate culm nodes and inflorescence fragments were also noted in sample
0012.
Other materials
The fragments of black porous `cokey' material and black tarry material may be derived from the
combustion of organic remains (including cereal grains) at very high temperatures. Bone
fragments were noted in nine samples, with burnt pieces occurring in samples 0070, 0172, 0164,
30
0166, 0178, 0180 and 0182. Fragments of burnt or fired clay (possibly pottery fragments) were
noted in all but two of the Early Bronze Age pit fills.

Discussion
The Early Bronze Age pit fills (Table 7)
The composition of these assemblages is strikingly similar. Although generally very small ( 0.1
litres volume), each assemblage contains hazel nutshell fragments and charcoal, and most also
contain burnt bone fragments and possible small pieces of pot. Such uniformity is unusual, but
may be the result of the incorporation of material spread from a common source. It is not known
at present whether such a source (for example a focus of domestic activity or a cremation pyre)
was located during excavation.
Although undated at present, the assemblages from samples 0172 and 0174 (Table 2) are
sufficiently similar to those noted above to be of the same Early Bronze Age date.
Other Early Bronze Age features (Table 8)
Sample 0013 was taken from a layer overlying pit 0004. The assemblage contains cereal
grains/chaff, weed seeds and common heather stem fragments, and would appear to be derived
31
from domestic hearth waste. Assuming that the material is not intrusive, the occurrence of spelt
in an Early Bronze Age context is very unusual. It is of especial note that the earliest record of
this crop from the region to date is from a contemporary context at West Row Fen (Martin and
Murphy 1988), situated only a few miles to the south west of the current site.
Iron Age pit 0008 (Table 8)
Sample 0012 was taken from the basal f of pit 0008. The assemblage consists almost entirely
of black bindweed seeds, with high densities of fat hen, barley and unidentified cereal grains also
being present. Although unusual, this assemblage may possibly be derived from an advanced
stage of cereal processing, where seeds and seed heads of a similar size to the grains are removed
by hand picking. It is tentatively suggested that parts of this assemblage may have been fired on
more than one occasion, as some seeds/grains are far more heavily burnt than others.
Other samples (Table 8)
The assemblages from samples 0025, 0060, 0070 and 0176 contain insufficient material to be
conclusively interpreted.
Conclusions and recommendations for further work
In summary, the assemblages from the Early Bronze Age pits are very uniform in character and
would appear to share a common source. The spelt chaff (and possible grain) from sample 0013
is an unusual find for the period and may be a further record of early spelt use/production in this
part of Suffolk. Sample 0012, from pit 0008 may indicate that cereal processing formed part of
the local economy during the Iron Age.
Although many of the samples are of potential interest, the assemblages are very small and
insufficient material is available to allow meaningful analysis. Therefore, no further work is
recommended at this stage. However, should further excavations be undertaken in this area, it is
strongly recommended that additional samples of the largest possible volume be taken (i.e.
complete pit fills) to facilitate analysis. If such work does occur, it may be possible to integrate
the current samples into an extended analytical programme at a later stage.
4.8 Discussion of the finds evidence
Finds and environmental evidence from the group of Early Bronze Age pits on this site suggests
that they were fairly uniform in nature and that the deposits may have been derived from a
common source. The material appears to be domestic waste and probably indicates occupation
in the near vicinity.
Later material included Iron Age pottery from four contexts, a single sherd of Roman pottery, a
piece of lava quern and a fragment of ceramic building material of uncertain date. Several metal
small finds were probably deposited as a result of casual loss or manuring in the post-medieval
period. <Node id="68235"/>Therefore, there is no evidence that this site was used intensively after the Early Bronze
Age<Node id="68329"/>, and had probably reverted to agricultural land by the Iron Age.
32
5. General Discussion
5.1. General
The excavation was requested in advance of development due to the richness of archaeological
material in the surrounding area, particularly the system of a Roman trackway and associated
fields and pens at ERL 089. Therefore there was potential for multi-period activity on the site, in
particular possible further evidence of the ERL 089 trackway and field system, as this system
would, if it headed directly towards the fen edge, pass through the site.
The excavation uncovered a relatively undisturbed landscape, the subsoil consisted of a mix of
sands and gravels with occasional pockets of windblown sand filling gentle depressions in what
would once have been a natural landscape of bumps and hollows. Clearly visible within this
subsoil was a well-preserved, low-density spread of archaeological features across the entire site.
An extension of the Late Iron Age/Roman field system of ERL 089 has been identified in
addition to two other phases of prehistoric activity.
5.2. Phase I: Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age
With the exception of the three scattered pits, 0004, 0069 and 0116 all the evidence of activity in
this phase occurs with the seventeen pits in group 0162 and the adjacent five pits 0221, 0223,
0227, 0229 and 0233.
These majority of these pits are substantial features and have survived intact with very little
disturbance or contamination. The presence of several smaller features may be a further
indication that this part of the site has seen limited truncation. Many of these pits are of a similar
size and form and each pit within the group is generally filled with a similar deposit, of sands
mixed with quantities of charcoal, indicating that these pits were infilled in a single short
deposition. Samples from these pits are being assessed for radiocarbon dating and any results
w be included at a later date with the site archive.
The finds from the individual pits are also very similar, forming a combined assemblage of over
eighty, late Beaker, domestic vessels, together with an assemblage of flint flakes and tools which
are characteristically associated with Beaker ware.
The range of domestic pottery types implies that the pit group is associated with occupation
activity. Within a context of occupation these features would most likely be interpreted as
domestic rubbish pits. <Node id="70751"/>An absence of burning of the surrounding natural sand within each pit<Node id="70820"/>
shows that <Node id="70832"/>they are not hearths and the charcoal deposits are showing deliberate infilling of open
features<Node id="70928"/>. They also do not appear to be structural features in any way, as there is <Node id="71004"/>no discernible
pattern to their spatial distribution or any sign of post settings<Node id="71085"/>.
Other possible functions of these pits, such as in funerary or ritual activity seems unlikely. <Node id="71182"/>None
of the pits contained any sign of cremations<Node id="71231"/> and this usage <Node id="71247"/>would not fit with the recovered
assemblage of domestic pottery<Node id="71310"/>.
However, within the extent of the site, this group of pits is almost totally isolated from other
contemporary features and there is no indication of nearby occupation. As the preservation of the
natural ground surface seems good this isolation appears to be genuine, although it may be due to
the pits location on the very edge of the site, or to an accident of preservation with other
settlement evidence being lost. <Node id="71730"/>The absence of any other occupation evidence such as structures<Node id="71793"/>
33
or, in particular, any hearths as a source for the charcoal, mean it is unclear if these pits are
definitely of a domestic origin. However this seems the most likely function and means that an
area of occupation probably lies in the near vicinity.
It is also of note that the Late Iron Age/Early Roman ditch, 0057, has a definite, albeit minor,
curve northwards in its course as it passes the pit group, before returning to its linear alignment.
This implies that the excavation and backfilling filling of these pits left some sort of noticeable
marker above ground, which was st visible for a considerable length of time.
Pit 0004 is of interest due to the presence of spelt in f 0013, an unusually early context for the
crop. This adds to the example of spelt found in an Early Bronze Age context at nearby West
Row (Martin and Murphy 1988), further indicating that spelt was being cultivated in the fen edge
region at this time.
5.3. Phase II: Iron Age
The four features identified as being Iron Age show only a limited activity in this period,
concentrated in one particular area of the site. The three pits are all substantial features and the
presence of charcoal and cereal grains implies that they are probably domestic refuse pits
although, as with the pit group in phase 1, <Node id="73081"/>there is no firm evidence of contemporary settlement
in the immediate vicinity<Node id="73159"/>. . They are somewhat similar to the Middle Iron Age pits in ERL 089
(Caruth 2003) and may represent that phase of activity extending over a wider area. The ditch
0002 appears to be contemporary although it may be a later feature relating to the phase IIIa
ditch system.
5.4. Phase III: Late Iron Age/ Early Roman
Phase IIIa: Late Iron Age/ Early Roman
This phase consists of a network of east-west and north-south ditches which cover the majority
of the site. <Node id="73620"/>Due to the almost total lack of finds from these ditches they are largely undatable<Node id="73703"/>,
however the assumption has been made that they form part of the same field system seen in ERL
089, which was more firmly dated (Caruth, 2003). This is because the features on the two sites
show extremely similar spatial characteristics in terms of layout and alignment and the sites
ought to be regarded together as showing one Late Iron Age/Early Roman field system.
The central components of activity in this phase are the two east-west aligned ditches, 0057 and
0082, which run parallel to each other, 11m apart, for a distance of at least 100m. They appear to
be marking some sort of trackway and this is very similar in terms of alignment and size to the
trackway identified in ERL 089, 100m to the east. The trackway in ERL 089 was slightly wider
at 15m, but is clearly on the same alignment, albeit offset to the north by approximately 65m
(Fig. 16). This indicates that the trackways may be contemporary, but separate features, as the
offset between the two seems too large to allow them to be the same linear feature, even when
the shifting in position of the ERL 089 trackway is taken into consideration. Alternatively they
may form a single continuous trackway, zig-zagging across the landscape.
Due to the lack of dating evidence though it is impossible to determine conclusively whether
these two trackways are contemporary, or whether one is a replacement of the other.
Further evidence of these trackways seems to have been found in monitoring of trenches at ERL
112 (Caruth, 2002). On this site ditches 0003 and 0004 appear to mark the continuing line of the
34
northern edge of the ERL 089 trackway (Fig. 16) and other ditches in sites ERL 111 and ERL
112 appear to follow either the east-west or north-south alignments of this field system.
Together these trackways seem to be part of a livestock management system. Caruth (2003)
suggests that the trackway in ERL 089 was a route to move livestock between winter pasture on
the heathland to the east and summer pasture to the west on the fen-edge. <Node id="75721"/>What type of livestock
this was is unclear<Node id="75763"/>, but it has been suggested as being most likely to be sheep due to the size of
the trackways and associated enclosures. The ditch system in this site supports this theory,
showing the continuation of a trackway eastwards to the fen edge, albeit offset to the south.

Figure 16. Trackway ditches in ERL 120, ERL 112 and ERL 089.
In addition to 0057 and 0082 there is a series of north-south ditches (0077, 0079/0080, 0124,
0125, 0130, 0136, 0151 and 0152), that run across and beyond the trackway. Relationships are
generally unclear and so there is little stratigraphic evidence but it seems that they are all broadly
contemporary. Where these ditches extend north and south of the trackway they are most likely
marking the division of the surrounding landland into fields and paddocks.
Unlike the north-south ditches in ERL 089, those that cross the trackway in ERL 120 appear to
do so fully, hence blocking it completely. At ERL 089 these north-south ditches only partially
blocked the trackway, implying some sort of gated management system to control the movement
of animals (Caruth, 2003). It is less clear whether this applies on this site, it is possible that the
north-south ditches did only block part of the trackway at any one time but have been moved or
recut leaving the impression of a total blockage. <Node id="77119"/>Alternatively it may be that some of these north-
south ditches are not contemporary with the trackway<Node id="77221"/>. They could be earlier field boundaries that
have been cut through or are later additions to the field system once the track had fallen out of
use.

Of particular interest with this field system is the similarity of the alignment of the trackways
with the alignment of the eastern end of the modern Lords Walk road. The western part of Lords
Walk currently turns slightly and runs along the south edge of the site, however if the line of the
eastern part of Lords Walk is extended, it directly corresponds with the ERL 120 trackway (Fig.
17). With the ERL 089 trackway being offset to the north of this proposed route, but parallel to
it, this may be showing that Lords Walk was originally based upon an older route, or aligned
with the associated field system. Caruth (2003) has suggested that Lords Walk is an ancient route
that can be seen as originating in these trackways running west from the heathland of Breckland
to the fen edge to the east.

The relationship of the ERL 120 trackway with the nearby fen edge is also of note as it lends
support to the idea that the trackways were designed to move livestock towards it. The line of the
fen edge extends eastwards at this point to within 200m of ERL 120, as seen on an aerial
photograph of 1946, although this has since been affected by the creation of the `Cut Off'
channel. The line of the trackway is heading directly towards this point and appears to be
marking the shortest route to the fen edge. At the western end of the site, ditch 0057 clearly

corners and heads south and this may represent the end of the trackway as it nears the fens.
Livestock that had been driven to this point would then presumably be moved into the fen edge
field systems.
As with ERL 089 <Node id="79341"/>no farm or domestic buildings have been identified in this phase<Node id="79405"/>. The ditches
of ERL 089 though did contain quantities of pottery implying that domestic occupation was
probably nearby to the north. In ERL 111 areas of buried soil, rich with finds, seem to be
scattered midden deposits and this indicated possible settlement as opposed to agricultural use in
this area (Caruth, 2002). <Node id="79725"/>The near total absence of pottery and other evidence of Late Iron
Age/Early Roman domestic occupation in ERL 120<Node id="79837"/> may be indicating that, as the trackway
heads east towards its end on the fen edge, it is moving further away from the settlement area.
Phase IIIB: Roman
Ditches 0064 and 0207 are on a slightly different alignment to those in phase IIIA and they
probably represent minor alterations to the earlier field system rather than a complete change to
it. This is because they st seem to be respecting the earlier trackway, ditch 0064 butt ends over
0057 before it crosses the trackway itself.
5.5. Phase IV: Post-Medieval
This phase, consisting of a small scatter of small finds in spread 0189, does not indicate a
substantial level of activity. As the finds were probably deposited during agricultural manuring
practices in the post-medieval period they demonstrate that the site was probably in use as open
agricultural land at this time.
5.6. Unphased
Unphased pits and ditches are scattered across the site and there are few conclusions to be drawn
from them. Ditches 0103 and 0026 may possibly be associated with the Roman ditch system
while 0203 and 0205 are clearly later. Several pits have stratigraphic relationships with the
Roman ditch system, 0053, 0061, 0072, 0109 and 0156. Three of these (0061, 0072 and 0109)
can be seen to be cut by the later Roman ditches and so are prehistoric in date and it seems likely
that many of the other scattered features are also of prehistoric date.
6. Conclusions
The excavation has shown four phases of activity, of which two are of particular interest, the
Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age pit cluster and the continuation of a Late Iron Age/Early
Roman trackway and field system continuing westwards from ERL 089 towards the fens.
The Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age pit group, 0162, is most likely a well preserved group of
domestic rubbish pits, although there is <Node id="81647"/>an absence of any contemporary occupation or
settlement evidence in the vicinity<Node id="81727"/>. Radiocarbon dates for samples from these pits w be
obtained at a later date and included with the site archive.
The field system is a continuation of sites seen at ERL 089, ERL 111 and ERL112 and is
therefore probably associated with the Late Iron Age and Roman settlement at Caudle Head
mere. The dispersed settlement around Caudle Head mere was known to extend south to ERL
089 and this site is further evidence of the fen edge systems of agricultural landuse that are
37
associated with it. The site has a lack of any other occupation evidence from the period, implying
that the settlement itself does not extend in this direction.
The evidence of a west-east aligned trackway, similar to that seen in ERL 089, adds further
support to the theory proposed by Caruth (2003) that there was a trackway system for the
movement of livestock, from the heathland to the west to the fen edge pastures. Finally this site
also supports the idea that the route of these trackways has possibly survived in the line of the
modern day Lords walk road.
<Node id="82769"/>As there is an absence of any other evidence after the Roman period<Node id="82836"/>, with the exception of the
post-medieval spread 0189, it is likely that the site then became open agricultural land, and has
remained so through to the present day.
7. Recommendations
The site has identified two phases of activity which are of particular interest. Possible further
work concerning the Iron Age/Roman trackway is limited however, as with the completion of the
development no further excavation is possible and <Node id="83263"/>there was virtually no artefactual evidence
recovered<Node id="83316"/>. However evidence for the possible droveway w be considered when other RAF
Lakenheath sites of Iron Age/Roman date are assessed for overall analysis and publication.
Any future development in the vicinity may also affect further evidence of this track and field
system, and ought to involve archaeological work with the aim of establishing the full course of
these droveways.
The Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age finds assemblage, the majority of which was recovered
from 0162, a discrete group of undisturbed features, is worth further analysis and possible
publication, perhaps as a paper for inclusion in the Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of
Archaeology and History. A more detailed study of the ceramic and flint assemblages, together
with selected illustration of the pottery, and, where possible, further enviromental analysis and
radiocarbon dating of the pit deposits, is required to fully assess this phase of activity.
Again, any future development within the vicinity has the potential to affect contemporary Late
Neolithic/Early Bronze Age occupation evidence and ought to involve archaeological input to
see whether this pit group is part of a wider phase of settlement.
