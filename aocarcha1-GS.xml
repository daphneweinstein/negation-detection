MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY
Following an evaluation in December 1998, an archaeological excavation was undertaken in 
April 1999 at Moselle Place, Tottenham by AOC Archaeology Group, in advance of a 
housing development. 
The archaeological investigations revealed the remains of a late medieval to early post
medieval manor house known as Crook's Farm. The house was first recorded on the Dorset 
Survey Map of 1619 as belonging to Sir Edward Barkham but the property was found to have 
begun life as a smallscale farmhouse, constructed in the late 15th
 or early 16th
 century. The 
early house was probably timberframed with chalkrubble foundations and ragstone and 
brick ground walls. Considerable alterations were made to the house during the 17th
 century, 
including the addition of a substantial new wing to the south. This contained a cellar and 
three hearths/fireplaces. Of principal interest in these investigations was the recovery of a 
large quantity of moulded plaster, discarded in the remains of the cellar. This material, 
originating from a decorated fretted ceiling, dates to the late 16th
 to early 17th
 century and 
comes from of a decorative scheme of surprisingly high quality, suggesting that the house 
was of considerably high status. Following demolition of the house, in the mid to late 18th 
century, a Georgian mansion house was constructed, known as White Hall. The mansion 
house was a Palladian style villa with associated landscaped gardens and a large 
ornamental pond. By 1864 the pond had been infilled and most of the grounds was now 
covered by terrace housing fronting Moselle Street. A portion of the site was st used as 
gardens and open space. The property was st discernable, although much altered in 1913 
(VCH 1976). The mansion house was demolished at some point between 1935 and 1961. In 
recent times the southern portion of the site was used as a concrete and tarmac playground, 
with the northern area having two sets of prefabricated garages placed on it, together with 
an area of hardstanding.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 SITE LOCATION (FIGS 1 AND 2)
The site considered by this report is located on a rectangular plot of land, directly 
bordered by William Street to the west, with Moselle Place to the southeast and nos. 
761767 Tottenham High Road to the east. The north of the site is bounded by 
residential flats which front onto White Hart Lane. The site is in the London Borough 
of Haringey and is centred at Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinates TQ 3384 
9134. The investigation area measures 1190.8 sq m.
1.2 PROJECT BACKGROUND
Planning consent was granted by the London Borough of Haringey for the 
development of the site for residential purposes, subject to a number of conditions. 
The fulfilment of the archaeological condition, in accordance with Planning and 
Policy Guidance 16 (DoE 1990), led to the implementation of a programme of 
archaeological investigation in order to assess the survival of the archaeological 
remains. In accordance with recommendations by English Heritage, an archaeological 
evaluation of the site was undertaken in December 1998. The full results are detailed 
in a separate report (AOC Archaeology Group, 1999a). The evaluation consisted of 
the recording of three machine excavated trenches. 
The evaluation found footings of at least seven walls, on a variety of alignments and 
constructed in differing manners, which would appear to belong to separate buildings. 
One of the walls also included evidence for an adjacent tilebuilt hearth. These dated 
to the postmedieval period and belong to a number of phases of the Crooks Farm 
mansion. They were overlain by deposits of demolition material which almost 
certainly represent destruction of the mansion buildings. A possible pond was also 
discovered which appeared to be contemporary with the buildings. Remains of further 
buildings dating to the 19th
 century were found cutting into the earlier postmedieval 
structures. Medieval pottery remains were located within one of the evaluation 
trenches, but the nature of these were to some extent ambiguous due in part to the 
limited area in which they were exposed. 
Due to the nature of the remains encountered, it was considered appropriate that 
measures be taken to mitigate the impact of the development on the site on the 
archaeological remains. It was therefore agreed between the developers, English 
Heritage (on behalf of the Local Planning Authority) and AOC Archaeology Group, 
that further investigation, of the area threatened by the development, would be carried 
out, in an attempt to better understand the surviving resource, and add to our current 
knowledge of the archaeology of Haringey.
1.3 ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
3 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
No previous archaeological observations had been conducted on the site prior to the 
evaluation.
1.3.1 Prehistoric 
The area of the site, located close to the watercourse of the River Lea, would possibly 
have been a focus for prehistoric activity. Evidence for prehistoric activity has been 
discovered in the area in the form of flint implements and animal bone, particularly 
along the course of the River Lea (Murray 1993). 
1.3.2 Roman 
The area of Tottenham lies outside of the main Roman settlement of Londinium, 
which focuses around the present day City of London. However, the Roman road, 
Ermine Street is thought to run north to south from London to Lincoln, skirting the 
Lea Marshes along the line of the present day Tottenham High Road situated to the 
east of the site (Murray 1993). The site was considered as having the potential to 
contain part of the Roman road. The medieval High Road appears to divert from the 
straight Roman road alignment, which has been lost from Stamford H through the 
Boroughs of Haringey and Enfield. <Node id="11350"/>No traces of a Roman settlement have been 
discovered in the area<Node id="11415"/>.
1.3.3 Saxon
Little is known about the early origins of Tottenham. Prior to the Norman invasion 
Tottenham resided in the administrative division of the Hundred of Edmonton. It is 
known from the AngloSaxon Chronicle that Danish invasions occurred in the region 
and that in 894 AD the Danes sailed up the River Lea reaching as far as Ware in 
Hertfordshire (Murray 1993). A settlement of AngloSaxon date is suggested for the 
area. The name Tottenham itself, is thought to have Saxon origins; it is described in 
the Domesday Book in 1086 as Totta's Ham (VCH 1976). This could translate as `the 
homestead of Tote' or `Tote's people'. Weinreb and Hibbert write that "in Saxon 
times it was evidently a clearing in the forest" (1983: 892). The Domesday Book 
details that the Lord of the manor of Tottenham at this time was Waltheof, the Earl of 
Northumberland (Murray 1993). Tottenham consisted of c. 872 acres of land 
consisting of common land and pasture and heavily wooded areas. Much of the area 
surrounding Tottenham would not have been suitable for cultivation, but the rich 
marshes close to the River Lea would have been suitable for farming (Murray 1993). 
It is thought that the Saxon settlement bordered the Roman road. 
1.3.4 Medieval
There is a record of a settlement in Tottenham from the medieval period (Protz 1998). 
Records indicate that there was a manor house in Tottenham in 1254, probably on the 
site of present day Bruce Castle. Tottenham was divided into seven lordships at this 
time (Weinreb Hibbert, 1983:893). Later, two more manor houses were built (VCH 
1976). The area flourished as people passed through on the London to Lincoln road. 
4 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
The site lies towards the southern extent of the Tudor ribbon development along the 
High Road, running south from Lower Edmonton.
1.3.5 PostMedieval and Modern
By 1600 Tottenham had gained a reputation as a prosperous area (Weinreb Hibbert, 
1983: 893). By the 17th
 century the forest had been cleared to such a degree that the 
only surviving wooded area was that of Wood Green (Weinreb Hibbert, 1983: 892). 
The Dorset Survey map of c.1619 (Fig 3) shows housing fronting the High Road a 
settlement which probably had earlier medieval origins. By the 18th
 century 
Tottenham had become a fashionable urban village. The local farms grew the crops 
for London markets. A number of mills were in action at this time used in the 
production of paper, oil and corn; however these burnt down and were rebuilt in 1788. 
1.3.6 The Site
The earliest cartographic evidence for the site is The Dorset Survey map of c.1619 
(Fig 3). The map indicates that the site was within the area occupied by Crook's Farm, 
belonging to Edward Barkham. In 1619 Edward Barkham held the largest freehold 
estate in the area. He was an alderman of London and held 174 acres in addition to 65 
acres of copyhold land (VCH 1976). Edward Barkham became Lord Mayor of 
London in 16212 and was knighted by James I in 1622. 
Crook's or Croke's Farm is thought to be named after John Croke, an alderman who 
held land in Tottenham at the end of the 15th
 century. At some point prior to 1619, 
Lionel Dalby, son of William Dalby, sold the property, with other land, to Edward 
Barkham (VCH 1976). The award for the 1619 survey states Crook's Farm consisted 
of:
`One Messuage Tenement or mansion house called Crooks Farme situate at the 
southeast corner of ye Vicarage lane together with ye Barnes Stables Orchard 
Garden and backside to ye same belonging containing in all One Close of pasture or 
meadowe ground adjoining to ye said Messuage on ye north parte and to the streete 
or high way leading from Ware towards London on the east parte..'
In 1634 the land passed to Edward Barkham's younger son Robert Barkham of 
Wainfleet, St Mary, Lincs, later also knighted. The land was acquired by his eldest 
brother, Sir Edward Barkham and in 1664 the property was assessed as containing 21 
hearths the second highest quota in the Edmonton Hundred (VCH 1976). Edward 
was made a baronet in 1623. The property continued to be passed down the Barkham 
family until 1728 when the main property was acquired by Ephrain Beauchamp. His 
son, Thomas, married Anne Proctor, and took the name BeauchampProctor on 
becoming a baronet in 1744. It is thought the house was rebuilt around this time and 
was certainly known as White Hall for some time prior to 1790, when the estate was 
sold. 
A Mr Abrahams from Houndsditch bought the mansion. He converted part of the 
grounds into a tan yard and built several barns, store houses, sheds and additional 
5 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
buildings (Robinson 1840). He became solvent insolvent and the buildings were 
pulled down, the materials sold, and the land sold on. The land was bought by Mr 
Andrews. The Parish Map of 1798 (Fig 4) shows the site at this time. The award for 
the survey states the land was owned by Mr Andrews and consists of `House, Yards, 
and Offices (458), Garden (459) and Four Acres (460) '. White Hall is shown as 
being `C' shaped with an additional wing to the west. An additional building appears 
to be abutting the property at the rear and the entrance is situated, to the north, from 
White Hart Lane. 
White Hall then passed to Henry Hunt (1820), to William May Simmonds, and in 
1827 to Charles Soames. Robinson's book of Tottenham was published in 1840 and at 
this time the land was st owned by Soames. The house (Fig 5) is described as brick 
built, covered with cement, fronting the grounds with a large lake supplied by piped 
water (Robinson 1840). The illustration shows a three storey Palladian style villa with 
a central pediment. The entrance for White Hall was formally on White Hart Lane but 
Soames erected a bridge over the River Moselle on the west side of the High Road, 
divided a barn into two neat lodges, and made this the entrance (Robinson 1840). The 
Tithe Map of 1844 (Fig 6) states that Charles Soames was the landowner and 
occupier. The land consisted of `Pleasure Ground Paddock, Buildings, Garden 
(1001), the Lake (1002), 2 lodges, plantation and garden (1003) and a Serpentine 
Walk (1004). By this time the footprint of the building was much altered; the west 
wing appears to have been demolished and the east wing extended. 
The house gave its name to Whitehall Street by the 1860's (Fig 7). By this time the 
lake had gone. Most of the grounds had been built over although a portion of the site 
was st used as gardens and open space. The property was st discernable, although 
much altered in 1913 (VCH 1976). The land use remains the same in 1935 (Fig 8). 
An eye witness watched the remaining part of White Hall demolished in 1961. Some 
time in the second half of the 20th
 century the site was developed as an electricity sub
station and garages were built (Fig 9). 
1.4 GEOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY
The site is located immediately west of the River Lea Valley. It is situated upon 
Kempton Park Gravels (drift geology) overlying London Clay (solid geology). 
2.0 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
A Written Scheme of Investigation, for preservation by record of those parts of the 
site that would be removed by the development, was designed in accordance with the 
Guidance Brief issued by English Heritage and with the agreement of the applicant 
(AOC Archaeology Group, 1999b).
The design of strip foundations for the proposed development was such that only 10% 
of the total area of the site was under threat of removal. Accordingly, excavation was 
to be limited to the areas of the foundations, to minimise the disturbance to the 
archaeological remains. In addition, provision was made for a more detailed degree of 
historical research to be undertaken, to supplement the results of the fieldwork.
6 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
The principal aims of the investigation were threefold:
� To establish, as was suggested by the cartographic evidence and the findings 
of the evaluation, whether the building was indeed part of the Crooks Farm 
mansion.
� To identify the earliest phase of occupation of the site (possibly medieval) and 
to establish whether this was related to the postmedieval development.
� To establish the chronological and spatial development of the site, from the 
establishment of the mansion, through to its abandonment, demolition and 
replacement by housing in the 18th
 and 19th
 centuries.
Provision was made for postexcavation analysis and a report to Level 3 as outlined 
by English Heritage in Management of Archaeological Projects (1991), with the scale 
of any publication report being dependant upon the results of the investigation. As a 
minimum requirement this would take the form of a note summary in the London 
Archaeologist annual excavation roundup. 
3.0 METHODOLOGY
Excavation was limited to the areas of the strip foundation trenches, to minimise 
disturbance to the archaeological remains.
Excavation of the strip foundation trenches was undertaken in approximately 10m 
lengths. This was conducted by JCB excavator and mini digger, each fitted with a 
600mm wide toothless bucket. The excavation of each length was to be undertaken in 
three to five spits, approximating to the following basic parameters:
Spit 1 Recent demolition material down to 5501100mm below present ground level, 
with no recording.
Spit 2 Tudor demolition material (where it existed in the western third of the area), 
down to 900mm below present ground surface, with fairly rapid 
recording. Material from this spit to be hand sorted at the side of the 
trench, to recover masonry details and finds.
Spits 35 Postmedieval and possibly medieval deposits, to be taken down 
carefully in one to three spits, down to c.11.1010.75m OD with 
recording undertaken as this happened. Provision was made for 
archaeologists to enter the trenches where appropriate to hand clean 
and excavate features, to enable the clarification of stratigraphic 
relationships and recover dating evidence. Temporary shoring was to 
be inserted into the trenches should excavation exceed 1.2m in depth.
7 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
A slight alteration to this methodology was enforced during the archaeological works, 
when it became apparent that the survival of the remains was more substantial than 
had previously been anticipated. Machine excavation of the trenches ceased in the 
area of the structural remains, after the removal of the demolition deposits outlined 
above. At this point, archaeologists entered the trenches to hand clean the remains, 
and proceed with the stratigraphic excavation and recording of the structures under 
threat.
Following the controlled removal of the threatened structural archaeological remains, 
the trenches were reexcavated by machine (under archaeological supervision), to the 
depth of the underlying natural deposits, or the depth required for the foundations, 
whichever was the higher.
The work was carried out in accordance with the procedures laid down in 
Archaeological Guidance Paper: 3, Standards and Practices in Archaeological 
Fieldwork (English Heritage London Region 1992), and in Appendix 1 of the Written 
Scheme of Investigation (AOC Archaeology Group 1999b). The work was monitored 
by Mr. Robert Whytehead of the Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service 
(GLAAS).
4.0 RESULTS
The methodology was employed at the behest of English Heritage in order to test the 
efficacy as a mitigation strategy for new developments employing such foundation 
designs. The excavation of strip foundations posed a number of problems with the 
recovery and interpretation of archaeological data. The principal objection to the 
excavation methodology was that stratigraphic correlation across the site was 
extremely difficult to implement. Local stratigraphic control could be maintained 
within a particular trench, but correlation between deposits and structures in 
geographically separate trenches was rendered very difficult because of the relative 
complexity of the stratigraphy coupled with the piecemeal nature of the excavated 
areas.
4.1 PERIOD 1: THE NATURAL DEPOSITS
The underlying natural deposit consisted of a robust orangeybrown clay/gravel mix 
(2/012), (3/007), (4/010), (5/023), (6/055), (7/072), (9/009), (11/057), (13/047), 
(14/028), (15/015), and (18/003). The layer was not homogenous, and some patches 
predominantly composed of clay were encountered, particularly towards the southern 
area of the site. The deposit was encountered across the site, generally sloping from 
the north of the site, where it was recorded as (4/010) at 11.71m OD, to the south 
where it was measured at 10.62m OD (3/007). The mixed nature of this material 
suggested that it would not have been suitable for quarrying for use either in the 
production of bricks or pottery, or for use as gravel aggregate in building 
construction. 
8 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
Overlying the gravel across much of the site was a deposit of firm grey silty clay 
(4/009), (5/021), (5/022), (6/051), (7/044), (8/023), (11/060), (12/057), (12/058), 
(13/046), (14/017), (15/013), (15/014), and (18/004). Undulations in the gravel 
resulted in this layer being over 0.50m thick in some areas, although generally, the 
deposit formed a layer approximately 0.30m deep. In one area at the northern end of 
the site, the material formed a bank (12/058), enhancing a corresponding bank in the 
gravel below to a level of 12.13m OD. This clay was itself overlain in some areas by a 
deposit of mottled grey/orange brickearth subsoil (11/060), although this material was 
not encountered with the same frequency. <Node id="25353"/>Both these deposits were largely absent 
from the south eastern area of the site, due to later horizontal truncation<Node id="25469"/> (Period 5).
4.2 PERIOD 2: C.1150C.1500
This phase was represented across most of the site by a dark brown, firm silty clay 
deposit (1/017), (2/011=2/014), (4/004), (5/027), (6/012), (8/022), (11/001=11/055), 
(12/055=12/056=12/054), (13/043), (14/024), most likely representing the long
compacted remains of an agricultural ploughsoil. This layer was generally found to be 
approximately 0.15m deep (12/055), although it was found to vary across the site 
from 0.10m (5/027) to 0.33m deep (4/004). Pottery fragments were retrieved from 
many of the areas where this material was identified, and provided a general date 
range for the deposit of approximately 11501400 for (4/004), to 14001500 in 
context (5/027). The majority of the fragments were small and heavily abraded, most 
likely indicating that they were deposited during manuring or night soiling episodes. 
As a point of note, this deposit was encountered during the evaluation phase in Trench 
2 (2/011), although due to the small size of the sampled area, it was identified as a 
possible pit fill. This interpretation can now be dismissed. 
4.3 PERIOD 3: C.1500C.1760
This period is characterised by the construction of the first building on the site, 
probably Crook's Farm, with a later phase of remodelling of the existing building. 
4.3.1 Crook's Farm 
General and Dating
Although an exact date for the initial construction of the first farmhouse building is 
unclear, analysis of the ceramic building material (CBM) has provided a generalised 
date range of approximately the late 15th
 to early 16th
 centuries. This first building was 
constructed on fairly robust chalk rubble and mortar foundations; many of which 
incorporated the CBM fragments used for dating purposes. The trenches for these 
foundations were excavated from the level of the ploughsoil, described above, or upon 
a preconstruction levelling layer (1/016), (5/009), (6/035), (8/021), (12/036), 
(12/052). Stratigraphically this layer was located either below the foundation trenches 
9 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
or the gravel layer (see below) exterior to the building. This layer was dated by CBM 
to the late 15th
 to early 16th
 century. Redeposited natural (12/052) contained CBM 
dating to c.12001500 but this is likely to be residual. Similarly, contexts (6/035) and 
(8/021) contained pottery dating to c.11501400 and 11401300 respectively. These 
deposits are likely to have derived from the local ploughsoil which was utilised as a 
levelling material. 
External Walls
The most northerly preserved sections of wall [11/051] and [12/048] from this period 
were probably part of the same external wall. The wall was constructed of roughly 
squared chalk blocks (300mm x 400m x 200m) bonded with fine mortar. The 
southern side was poorly faced in contrast to the northern side, which was flatter; 
supporting the theory that this was the front wall of the property. The top of wall 
[11/051] was observed at 12.28m OD and [12/048] at 11.66m OD. Wall [11/051] was 
capped with three courses of randomlycoursed bricks laid on edge [11/056]. Another 
probable section of external wall [7/041] formed a corner return in Trench 7. It was 
constructed of clay bonded, roughlyhewn ragstone upon a randomlycoursed chalk 
and mortar foundation, with occasional tile [7/045] and [12/047]. The foundations 
measured 2.67m+ eastwest by 0.54m northsouth and is likely to be part of the same 
structure as [6/037], to the north. Another section of chalk foundations [1/024] was 
identified to the west of the site and ran northsouth. This consisted of irregular chalk 
rubble, measuring 1.65m+ northsouth by 0.30m eastwest and c.0.40m high. Crook's 
Farm appears to have been constructed with chalk foundations and brick and ragstone 
ground walls. The building is likely to have been timber framed with the timber 
elements built upon the ground walls. 
Internal Walls
Possible internal chalk foundations were identified across the site. Two parallel 
narrow foundation strips, [8006] and [8007], ran northsouth in the southern part of 
the site. These were constructed of randomlycoursed, roughlyhewn chalk blocks 
with occasional probable imported volcanic rock and were bonded with a sandy 
mortar. These were identified at 12.19m OD and 12.25m OD respectively. Two 
probable internal walls were identified in the western part of the site in Trench 11. 
Foundation, [11/052] ran eastwest and was constructed from roughlysquared, 
roughlyhewn chalk blocks (350m x 250m x 200mm) with a lime mortar. Foundation 
[11/021] was constructed of irregular chalk blocks with lime mortar and was running 
eastwest. The structure measured 0.50m northsouth by 0.60m+ eastwest and was 
0.30m deep. In Trench 12, a probable eastwest internal foundation wall [12/050] was 
also constructed of randomlycoursed chalk blocks bonded with lime mortar but was 
built upon a single layer of unbonded fragmentary tile.
Construction Debris
Three probable early construction debris deposits were identified. Deposit (4/003) 
was a firm grey brown silty clay with frequent tile fragments and occasional charcoal. 
This was dated by CBM to 15001800 and pottery 14801650. Deposit (5/025) was 
10 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
40mm thick, consisted of broken tile and degraded chalk and was visible in section 
only. <Node id="30924"/>There was no dating evidence within the deposit as the tile was too fragmentary 
to identify<Node id="31016"/>. Layer (11/064) was a 30mm thick deposit of sandy clay with frequent tile 
and chalk fragments, measuring 1.81m northsouth by 0.60m eastwest and tile from 
it was dated to c.12001500. 
Layout and Form
It is difficult to ascertain the exact size of the building, due to the nature of the 
investigation. It was clear that a number of rooms existed within the confines of the 
building and that it was probably larger than a standard medieval farmhouse of 
possibly only two or three rooms. Even given the limited area of the building 
exposed, it is possible to define distinct areas of internal and external space to the 
building in this initial phase. It was noted on some sections (e.g. Section 12) that the 
areas between the chalk foundations contained no evidence of the ploughsoil of 
Period 2. It is presumed that this material was deliberately removed during the 
construction process, possibly to provide a more consolidated building surface. At a 
similar level, but on the "outside" of the foundations, was a consolidated, 30120mm 
thick, gravel surface (4/002), (5/013), (5/014), (6/033), (8/012), (8/019), (11/019), 
(11/061), (11/063), (12/028), (12/035), (12/039), (12/041) and (13/029) which in 
some cases butted up to the foundations themselves, although in most areas the 
relationship had been destroyed by later robbing activity. This appeared to be the 
remains of a metalled gravel surface that apparently extended around the outside of 
the original building, both to the front and rear of the property. Although only seen in 
section, this layer extended at least 6.6m to the north of what is presumed to be the 
front wall of the property [11/051], [12/048], where it continued into the northern 
section. The layer became thinner closer to the building which may be an indication 
of wear, although this is not possible to substantiate. <Node id="32882"/>No dating evidence was 
recovered from this layer<Node id="32931"/>; however, the stratigraphy indicates that this material related 
to the earliest phase of the building, rather than being part of any of the later 
alterations and additions.
4.3.2 Addition of the Southern Wing
General
Sometime in the early part of the 17th
 century, a substantial southern wing was added 
to the existing farmhouse. The 1619 Dorset Survey map (Fig 3) suggests that the farm 
consisted of two buildings, including a southern one with at least two stories; which is 
indicative of a higher status property. The addition of the southern wing evidently 
made Crook's Farm an altogether grander residence and this improvement probably 
coincided with an upturn in the fortunes of the Barkham family as by 162021 Sir 
Edward became Lord Mayor of London.
Construction Sequence
The archaeological sequence identified in this phase consists of the levelling and 
demolition of earlier walls followed by the construction of the new building 
11 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
(including walls, cellars, hearths, a chimney and internal floors). The stratigraphic 
sequence of this phase is best observed in Trench 7. A 0.6m layer of redeposited 
brickearth (7/020, 7/071) was used as a levelling layer. This was overlain by small 
dumps (both measuring c.0.40m diameter) of clay (7/052 and 7/055). These were 
followed by a demolition dump of brick and tile (7/059) and then the deposition of a 
chalk destruction dump (7/033, 7/056 and 7/057); probably relating to an earlier chalk 
foundation, possibly [7/045]. Deposit (7/059) was dated by CBM and pottery to 
15801700 and (7/056) to 15001800 also by CBM and pottery. Similar levelling 
layers and dumps were seen throughout the site: (1/012), (1/013), (1/014), (2/007), 
(4/013), (6/046), (7071), (7/020), (7/042), (7/055), (7/052), (7/059), (11/011), 
(11/053), (11/054), (14/014). 
Elements of the South Wing Construction
The construction of the new wing followed. The foundation observed in Trench 7 was 
chalk with an underlying brick and tile hardcore [7/061] measuring 1.4m+ eastwest 
by 0.30m deep. The foundation was not mortared and was very different in 
construction from the earlier chalk foundations. A nonload bearing structure [7/038] 
identified in Trench 7 measured 1.18m+ eastwest by 0.23m+ northsouth by 0.48m 
deep and was interpreted as a chimney stack. It consisted of a stretcher bonded red 
brick wall [7/038], with rubble packing (7/037) and an underlying bedding clay 
(7/038) within a construction cut [7/043]. Packing (7/037) contained a fragment of 
sixteenth century window glass, suggesting that the rubble packing consisted at least 
in part of demolition materials. 
An eastwest internal brick wall [1/025] and a pitchedtile hearth [1/025], [6/042] of 
the southern wing were recorded in Trench 1. The wall consisted of bricks laid on 
edge with one course of bricks laid on bed along the south side. The hearth was 
located immediately to the east of this and measured 1.6m northsouth by 0.6m+ east
west. The hearth was within a cut, the primary f of which consisted of a charcoal 
matrix. The northern section of the hearth was constructed of vertical tiles running 
eastwest, forming an edging, with the remaining vertical tiles running northsouth. 
Some of the tiles were glazed. Four peg tiles sample were taken for dating purposes 
and these were dated to 12001800; although two tiles dated to 12001500 are thought 
to be reused.<Node id="36421"/> There was no evidence of burning to indicate the orientation of the 
hearth itself<Node id="36504"/>. Another pitchedtile hearth [13/020] was recorded in Trench 13. It was 
semicircular (measuring 1.60m by 0.70m) and may have been associated with the 
remnants of a ragstone and tile structure, of unknown function, to the west. The 
remains of a brick plinth [12/045] for a fireplace of late 16th
 to 17th
 century date was 
identified within Trench 12. It measured 0.38m+ by 0.26m+ and was 0.06m deep and 
appears to have been associated with wall [12/047]. 
Cellar
The remains of a large cellar were seen in Trenches 8, 11 and 13. The construction cut 
was verticallysided and covered an area of at least 6.77m northsouth by 4.6m east
west (31.14m2)
. In Trench 11, a section of the cellar wall [11/032] ran northsouth and 
was constructed of red brick laid in English bond with lime mortar. The wall was 
12 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
heavily truncated or `robbed out' and measured 2.02m+ eastwest by 0.48m+ north
south and was 0.81m+ high. A small portion (0.30m by 0.20m) of brick wall was 
visible in the south facing section of Trench 7. <Node id="37614"/>No wall was identified in Trench 8<Node id="37648"/> but 
its location was indicated by a `robber' trench [8/025]. 
A 2040mm thick layer of mortared bedding (13/039=13/036), (8/024), was laid 
before the construction of the cellar floor. In Trench 8 the majority of brickwork had 
been `robbed' leaving only the mortared bedding with a small portion of brick floor at 
the west corner. Staining from individual bricks was evident on the deposit. The 
remains of two consecutive brick cellar floors were recorded in Trenches 11 and 13. 
The first floor [11/041], [13/035] was constructed above the mortared bedding 
surface. In Trench 11 the brickwork (dated to late 16th
 to 17th
 century) only covered 
approximately half the area, the remainder consisted of a layer of firm dark brown 
grey sandy clay with gravel and CBM fragments (11/044). The function of this layer 
is unclear; it may be construction trample or related to the `robbing' of the brickwork. 
A northeast to southwest running brick drain [11/045, 11/050] was incorporated 
within the cellar floor, contemporary with the first floor. The area was then built up 
and levelled with a layer of clay (11/046) and a dump of CBM (11/043). Overlying 
this was a lens of dark silty clay (11/042) followed by a layer of bedding sand 
(11/040). These features were sealed by the second brick floor [11/029], [13/034], 
which was also dated to the late 16th
 to 17th
 century. The floor in Trench 11 
encompassed a gully [11/039] which protruded into the drainage channel below. The 
brick floor was cut by several postholes [11/036], [11/034], [11/033], [11/038] and 
[11/048], which would have held posts that provided support for the cellar ceiling. It 
is unclear as to why two floors were constructed in the cellar; it may be that there was 
poor drainage or that the first floor subsided.
Internal Floors
Several internal floors were identified which appear to relate to the remodelling of the 
building and the construction of the southern wing. In Trench 7 a floor was 
represented by a 0.05m clay dump (7/048) overlying a rubble and clay bedding 
surface (7/049), within a cut [7/050] measuring 0.65m+ x 0.050.15m deep. This floor 
appears to respect the cut for the cellar [11/031]. <Node id="39846"/>There was no dating evidence for 
these deposits<Node id="39894"/>. Respecting foundation [7/041] and structure [7/038] was a 100mm 
thick gravel layer (7/017). Overlying this was a 200mm thick, `occupation' layer 
(7/018) consisting of black silty clay with occasional CBM flecks and charcoal. 
Again, unfortunately there was <Node id="40155"/>no dating evidence for these deposits<Node id="40192"/>. Another 
possible floor surface (6/008) is thought to be associated with hearth [6/042]. The 
deposit consisted of black friable charcoal and silt, with no inclusions for dating 
purposes. Flooring of this type appears quite rudimentary for such a high status 
property; however, it is feasible that they would have been covered with floorboards. 
A brick floor [11/012] in Trench 11 was constructed of bricks on a chalk foundation 
and measured 0.60m+ eastwest by 0.65m+ northsouth. The brickwork consisted of 
four rows of bricks, orientated eastwest, laid on bed and was dated to the late 15th
 to 
early 16th
 century. Either side of this floor was evidence of robbed out walls [6/016] 
which suggests that this may have been a corridor. Also in Trench 11, a 0.16m thick 
sandy clay bedding layer (11/067) overlay two consecutive levelling deposits 
13 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
(11/068), (11/069). Overlying this was a layer (11/066) containing a high frequency 
of demolition material, which has been interpreted as the robbing of the floor. These 
deposit were located between walls [11/021] and [11/051] and appear to respect these 
features. <Node id="41410"/>Unfortunately the deposits contained no dating evidence<Node id="41465"/>.
Evidence for a Decorated Plasterwork Ceiling
A large quantity of moulded plaster was discovered in the backf (11/008) of a later 
(Period 4) robber cut within the large cellar [11/031] on site. These originate from a 
decorated fretted plaster ceiling and coving dating to the late 16th
 or early 17th
 century 
(Appendix B). It is likely that the plasterwork relates to this phase of structural 
alteration when the southern wing was added. The decorative scheme would have 
been relatively high status. The standard moulding consists of a bead moulding 
bordering the flat face of a run, with a square quirk and a cavetto moulding on the 
outer side. The flat faces are decorated with various floral motifs (buglelike flowers, 
grapes, heraldic roses), mostly of a running design. Coving decorations consisted of 
flower bosses and human heads. Fretted ceilings were popular in the late Elizabethan 
and Jacobean periods. For a much richer effect, the salient components, ribs, bosses, 
or pendants, might be painted and/or gilded. It is thought this was the case at Moselle 
Place as two pieces show paint; a flat section painted brown and pink with a tendril 
pattern in black and a piece of cyma recta painted pink. There was no evidence of 
gilding on the plasterwork.
Other Period 3 Features
One pit relates to this period; which was section only. In Trench 6 a steep sided pit 
[6/029] with a Ushaped base was recorded. The location and depth of the pit suggests 
this may have a spatial relationship to hearth [1/025], [6/042]. The only find 
recovered from the f (6/029) was a 15th
 century copper alloy token. This originated 
from the Low Countries and was inscribed with `Vive Le Roi'. This may have a 
religious significance or could simply be a trade token. In the evaluation phase a 
possible pit [2/008] was identified. The pit measured 0.64m+ northsouth x 1.4m+ 
eastwest x 0.2m deep. In Trench 14 <Node id="43383"/>two pits [14/016], [14/036] were recorded which 
contained no dating evidence or an indication as to their function<Node id="43498"/>. Stratigraphically 
they are likely to be associated with Period 3. <Node id="43567"/>Similarly, pit [13/024], measuring 
0.84m diameter x 0.33m deep, contained no dating evidence<Node id="43660"/>.
An isolated posthole [8/010] was recorded in Trench 8 cutting into the natural 
deposits. This measured c.0.46m diameter and was 0.23m deep with a vertical post 
pipe. Pottery recovered from the f (8/009) was dated to 14801650. In Trench 13 an 
isolated stakehole [13/026], measuring c.0.17m diameter x 0.17m deep, was recorded 
cutting into the ploughsoil. There was no dating evidence for this feature. 
4.4 PERIOD 4: C.17601900
This period is represented by the demolition of Crook's Farm, with the systematic 
demolition and robbing of the materials, and the construction of a Georgian mansion 
14 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
house, known as White Hall (Fig 5). The mansion was situated to the north of the site 
and had associated outbuildings and landscaped gardens with a large ornamental pond
4.4.1 Demolition of Crook's Farm
The demolition of the property, occurred at some point between 1744 and 1790, and 
appears to have been undertaken in a systematic and controlled way. The demolition 
backf of the cellar itself (11/008) was highly indicative of controlled robbing; being 
composed almost exclusively of smashed plaster and mortar fragments, ranging in 
size from the large pieces retained and described previously, to something nearer dust 
� apparent evidence of a concerted effort to clean the brick being recovered from the 
building of any adhering material. It seems clear that the demolition episode was not 
merely an exercise in destruction and levelling, but a wellorganised, disciplined 
removal of the reuseable materials, with only the useless, broken fragments left 
behind. Several `robber' trenches were identified across the site [4/008], [4/015], 
[5/016], [6/016], [6/025], [7/014], [7/022] [7/046], [7/064], [8/025], [11/016], 
[11/018], [13/031], [13/041], and [13/045]. These were dated to this period either by 
their stratigraphic position or through pottery or CBM in the backfill. 
Demolition layers were identified throughout the site (5/011), (6/007), (6/036), 
(6/031), (7/069), (7/033), (11/002), (11/10), (11/070), (12/034), (12/057), (13/017), 
(13/019),(13/022), (13/028), (14/019) and (14/021). The nature of these deposits 
varied across the site; some of these deposits had noticeable chalk content within their 
soil matrices. Deposit (6/007), which probably originates from the partial robbing of 
wall [6/037], was recorded for 2.2m wide and measured 50mm. It consisted of hard 
white crushed chalk and was recorded at 12.21m OD. Layer (14/019), a friable dark 
brown clay contained frequent CBM and pottery and a small reddishpurple glass 
bead (3mm diameter by 2mm). 
4.4.2 White Hall
Levelling 
Prior to the construction of the mansion house, at some point a sequence of ground 
levelling occurred through dumping and `makeup' layers. Levelling deposits 
attributed to this period are; (2/005), (4/013), (5/005), (5/007) (5/012=5/017), (6/016), 
(6/017), (7/017), (7/023), (7/024), (8/005), (8/028), (8/032), (8/033), (11/018), 
(11/020), (11/028=11/065), (11/038), (12/038=12/060), (12040), (12/042), (13/018), 
(13/041), (15/012). In general, these deposits were seen at the northern end of the site, 
probably due to the northerly location of the new building. <Node id="46947"/>Dating of these deposits is 
problematic due to the lack of pottery recovered<Node id="47024"/>. The CBM date range of 15001800 
is not particularly helpful. The documentary evidence suggests the construction of the 
house occurred at some point between 1744 and 1790. Some deposits of a markedly 
different character were recorded within the house walls, (7/023), (12/038=12/060), 
(12040) which may have been the remains of clay floors, although given the obvious 
status of the property, this seems improbable. 
External Walls
15 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
The structures dating to this period are generally located in the northern portion of the 
site, which correlates with the cartographic evidence for the site (Fig's 4 6). The 
buildings appear to be on a slightly different alignment to the earlier one. Several 
portions of the external walls were observed across the site. A red brick and sandy 
mortar wall [1/008], [6/004] ran northwest to southeast and measured 2.80m+ by 
0.49m and was 0.44m high. The wall was laid in English bond and it had <Node id="48051"/>no visible 
foundation course<Node id="48080"/>. The brickwork was dated to the late 17th
 to 18th
 century. A George 
III coin, dating to 1806, was found in f (6/038) of the construction cut for the wall. 
This later date for the construction of the wall is probably due to remodelling of the 
property. The Parish Map of 1798 (Fig 4) shows a different building footprint to that 
shown in 1844 (Fig. 6) Another large section of wall [5/004], [11/006], also ran on the 
same alignment and measured 6.6m+ by 0.6m and was 0.35m high, the top of which 
was at 12.69m OD. This was also constructed of red brick laid in English bond with 
sandy mortar. The brick of this wall dates to the late 15th
 to early 16th
 century; 
however the stratigraphy indicates this must be later and is probably contemporary 
with wall [1/008], [6/004], suggesting that the brick had been reused from the Crooks 
Farm building. A similar red brick external wall [12/030], that ran eastwest, was seen 
in Trench 12. Also in Trench 12 was the possible foundation of an external wall 
[12/022], [8/044] on an eastwest alignment and constructed of randomly coursed 
yellow brick with lime mortar. The brick was a mixture of types dating to the late 16th 
to 17th
 century and the 17th
 and 18th
 century; suggesting that the brick was reused. 
Internal Walls
In Trench 1 an internal wall [1/026] of 17th
 to 18th
 century red brick laid in English 
bond with lime mortar, ran northwest to southeast and may have been related to the 
external red brick walls on the same alignment. It measured 0.80m+ by 0.30m by 
0.15m high. Associated with this wall and external wall [1/008], [6/004] was a brick 
floor [1/028]. The brick from the floor was dated to the late 18th
 century. In Trench 
13, a trench built brick soakaway [13/016] measured 1.18m northsouth by 0.60m 
deep. The f of the soakaway contained pottery and CBM dating to the late 17th
 to 
18th
 century. In Trench 8 a red brick soakaway measured 0.91m eastwest x 0.32m 
deep; this was visible in section only. In Trench 12 a foundation wall [12/025] was 
identified in section only. It was constructed of red brick dating to the late 15th
 to early 
16th
 century laid in random courses. Pottery recovered from the f of the construction 
cut dates it to the 19th
 century suggesting that the brick used in this wall had been 
robbed from earlier walls. The wall ran eastwest but it is unclear if it was and 
external or internal wall.
Lake
A large pond/lake was identified to the south of the site in Trenches 3, 9 and 14. 
Historical maps (Figs 4 6) show a large irregular feature to the south of White Hall 
and the award associated with the 1844 map describes this as a lake. In Trench 9 this 
was visible for 7m+ eastwest with a maximum depth of 2.15m deep [9/008]. The 
sides were at an angle of 45� and the base was slightly concave. The same feature was 
observed in Trench 14 [14/022], [14/032] but was visible in section only. During the 
16 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
evaluation phase the lake [3/012] measured 5.5m+ eastwest by 1.7m+ wide by 2m 
deep. The overall dimensions of the lake were, at least, 12.7m by 12.4m. The primary 
organic basal f was a black sticky organic clay (3/011), (9/011), (14/029), 0.65m 
thick, containing pottery dating to 15001800. A 16th
 century drinking glass was 
recovered from this deposit. Layers of natural silting (3/010), (9/006), (9/007), 
(9/010), (14/022), (14/030) were above this deposit. These layers were found to 
contain a relatively large amount of broken, unabraded pottery dating to 15601750. 
It seems likely that this material represents localised rubbish disposal. Cartographic 
sources depict the lake from 1798 to 1844 and it had been infilled by 1864.
Garden Soil
A layer of garden soil (6/034), (12/027) was observed in two areas of the site. In both 
instances the layer immediately overlay the external gravel surface of Period 3. The 
deposit consisted of a silty clay loam with a high gravel content; possible due to 
bioturbation of the soil with the deposit below. The layer measured 0.20.35m thick, 
and contained CBM dating to 15001800. It is thought these layers represents the 
garden of the Georgian house.
Rubbish Disposal
Four refuse pits were assigned to this period. Large pit [13/027=15/011] was seen in 
section only and measured 4.2m by 1m deep and probably served the Georgian 
mansion house. The f of the pit (13/002, 13,003, 13,004, 13,005, 13,006, 13007, 
13/008, 13/009, 15/010) consisted of a successive layers. In addition to burnt daub, 
fragments of glass bottles, pottery and CBM the f contained typical food refuse; 
animal bone, cockles, muscles and oyster shell. A copper alloy pin was also found in 
the fill. The CBM and pottery dates to 15801900, a broad range but three fragments 
off glass bottles in (13/007) were dated to the late 18th
 early 19th
 century and this is 
probably an indicative date of the feature. Pit [6/019] was heavily truncated and seen 
in section only. The f (6/006) was a green brown clay silt with occasional charcoal 
flecks. Finds recovered from the f consisted of animal bone, clay pipe, CBM and 
pottery dating to 17541900. Pit [13/013] measured at least 0.7m eastwest by 3.0m 
northsouth by 1.52m deep. The f consisted of a compact yellow brown sandy clay 
and contained CBM, pottery, animal bone, a corroded piece of iron and a copper alloy 
ornamental fastening. Of particular note was a pantile dating to the 17th
 to 18th
 century 
which may be indicative of the type of roofing at White Hall. In the evaluation phase 
a large (1.4m northsouth by 1.7m eastwest and 1.1m deep) rectangular pit was 
recorded [2/010]. The fill, (2/009) consisted of mixed deposits containing frequent 
CBM, occasional pottery, slate and glass. The CBM was dated to the 16th
 to 18th 
century. <Node id="53945"/>Several small pits of unknown function, with no dating evidence, were 
assigned to this period<Node id="54039"/> [6/052], [6/053], [8/016], [11/027]. 
4.4.3 19th
 Century Housing
Between 1844 and 1864, Moselle Street itself was created to the south of the site, and 
a short terrace of six houses was constructed, the gardens of which encompassed 
approximately half of the present site (Fig 7). These properties had cellars which 
17 �AOCARCHAEOLOGYGROUP � NOVEMBER2005
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
removed most of the deposits at the south of the site, partially accounting for the 
difficulties encountered in attempting to link the large water feature to the manor 
house. It is possible that some of these properties had outbuildings to the rear of the 
gardens, as a number of brick foundations were encountered, which are seemingly 
unrelated to any other structures (e.g. 2/015) However, the date range for this feature 
taken from analysis of the CBM suggested an earlier 16001800 period: This is a 
similar date to that given for wall [3/004], [3/005], [3/006], which was found below 
the level of the cellars for the houses of this phase. It is unclear whether this wall 
actually related to the houses or not. It is possible that a building of which virtually 
nothing survived was constructed at the southern end of the site sometime in the early 
to mid 18th
 century, although the cartographic evidence would not support this. It 
seems therefore more reasonable to assume that during the 19th
 century, some of the 
building material of the old manor house st remained on the site, either as 
upstanding remains or stockpiled raw materials, and was reused. The evidence noted 
in the sections of `robber' trenches cutting in from relatively high levels would appear 
to substantiate the former of these hypotheses. 
Material from this phase was found as unconsolidated rubble, mainly within the 
confines of the cellars of the 19th
 century houses. Taking into account the position of 
the properties over the underlying backfilled water feature, it seems likely that the 
houses suffered a significant degree of subsidence during their lifetime, with their 
continued survival eventually becoming impossible. Some attempt at ground 
consolidation prior to construction had taken place in the area of the backfilled cellar, 
with a large gravel dump being cut into the soft plaster remains (2/013) and this had 
been largely successful. However, it appears that the apparent robust nature of the 
upper brickearthtype fills of the water feature had fooled the Victorian engineers into 
thinking the ground was solid enough to withstand the weight of the properties. It is 
probable that signs of structural failure appeared relatively soon after the houses were 
constructed, although material found within the deposits suggested the demolition 
itself was likely to have taken place in the postwar period. Largely it appeared that 
the houses had been pushed into their own cellars, and the deposit levelled off to form 
a flat surface suitable for reuse.
Towards the northern area of the site a number of garden soil deposits (6/002), 
(7/002), (12/008) and pits were identified, which have been tentatively assigned to 
this period, although it is highly possible that these deposits could relate to the open 
area on the northern part of the site which is evident on the 1864 Ordnance Survey 
map (Fig 7). This area appears to have been used for dumping for some time, with 
evidence noted for possible hearth clearances (8/002), rubbish pitting (12/003, 
12/005) and general dumping (12/010). 
4.5 PERIOD 5: 20TH
 CENTURY
4.5.1 Demolition of White Hall
Following the demolition of the house, which occurred at some point between 1935 
and 1961, the site appears to have reverted to an open space. Certainly towards the 
northern area of the site, no further construction appears to have taken place until that

of the prefabricated garages in the 20th
 century, with what appeared to be garden soils 
(12/023), (12/033), (14/007), being laid down over the preceding demolition deposits 
and some pitting and dumping taking place. The construction of the later houses to 
the south of the site had removed most of the deposits down to the upper surface of 
the natural gravel in this area, so it is unclear as to whether this part of the site 
remained open for any period of time, or if the construction of the houses was 
instantaneous. 
4.5.2 Modern
In recent times the southern portion of the site was used as a concrete and tarmac 
playground, with the northern area having two sets of prefabricated garages placed on 
it, together with an area of hardstanding. This formed the extant landscape when the 
evaluation was undertaken in 1998 and was measured to a maximum level of 12.20m 
OD at the north of the site, to 11.78m OD at the south. These structures had been 
demolished and removed by the time of the further investigation, and excavation 
commenced during these works at 11.85m OD at the north of the site, sloping to 
11.59m OD in the south eastern corner of the site.

5 DISCUSSION
The first activity recorded on site was medieval ploughing. The evidence for this was 
a ploughsoil that contained a collection of small and heavily abraded pottery (dated 
c.11501400). At some point in the late 15th 
to early 16th
 century, Crook's Farm, a 
timberframed farmhouse with ragstone and brick ground walls and chalkrubble 
foundations was constructed. Remodelling of the building is thought to have occurred 
in the early 17th
 century when the property was owned by Sir Edward Barkham, an 
alderman who later became Lord Mayor of London. By the 17th
 century it was 
established practice for both courtiers and merchants to acquire or build houses within 
easy reach of London. Crook's Farm became a property of high status; documentary 
evidence of 1664 states that it contained some 21 hearths, the second highest in 
Edmonton Hundred at the time and three hearths/fireplaces were identified within the 
limited excavation area. In addition, a large amount of highly decorative moulded 
plasterwork from a high status fretted ceiling and coving attributed to this period was 
found within a demolition deposit. 
The remodelling and addition of the southern wing at Crook's Farm occurred during a 
period in England known as the `Great Rebuilding'. Originally this was defined by 
Hoskins (1953) as occurring between 1570 and 1640 but more recent scholarship 
holds that there was a continuous process of building and rebuilding from the Tudor 
period through the 18th
 century. The `Great Rebuilding' was characterised by the 
rebuilding of many high status homes in response to changing elite living 
requirements. Medieval wooden houses were gradually replaced with stone houses. 
<Node id="60959"/>Not all higher status medieval properties were replaced<Node id="61014"/>; many were adapted and 
extended to meet new demands. This period witnessed medieval open halls floored 
over, new chimneys and staircases inserted, and the introduction of glazed windows 
and new furnishings. This appears to have been the case at Crook's Farm; Sir Edward 
Barkham required a higher status property that would have expressed the owner's 
social position. Rather than demolishing the existing building, it was remodeled to 
meet his requirements. 
By 1790 Crook's Farm was demolished and a Georgian mansion house known as 
White Hall was constructed. The demolition of the property appears to have been 
undertaken in a systematic and controlled way, evidenced by the nature of the 
demolition deposits within dumps and robber trenches. There is evidence for the re
use of building materials both stratigraphically and from the specialist analyses. The 
illustration (Fig 5) of White Hall in 1840 shows a Palladian villa. Palladianism was 
strongest in England between 1715 and 1755 which supports the documentary 
evidence which suggests the house was constructed between 1744 and 1790. The 
excavation also located a large ornamental water feature, which is depicted on 
cartographic sources from 1798 to 1844. By 1864, it had been infilled (Fig 7) and 
most of the grounds were covered by terrace housing fronting Moselle Street. A 
portion of the site was st used as gardens and open space. The property was st 
discernable, although much altered in 1913 (VCH 1976) but was demolished at some 
point between 1935 and 1961. In recent times the southern portion of the site was

used as a concrete and tarmac playground, with the northern area having two sets of 
prefabricated garages placed on it, together with an area of hardstanding.

APPENDIX B
THE FINDS
The Pottery 
Lucy Whittingham 
Introduction
121 sherds (2.6 kg) have been examined for this assessment and are recorded using 
the pottery codes currently employed by Museum of London Specialist Services 
(MoLSS). All of the sherds have been quantified recording sherd count, weight, rim 
diameter and estimated vessel equivalent (EVE), the details of which are on an Excel 
database and can be consulted with the site archive. 
Results 
Of the thirty nine contexts which produced a ceramic assemblage, twenty nine have 
post medieval assemblages and seven medieval. Three are of a mixed date. The 
majority of the larger sherds in this assemblage are in late post medieval wares such 
as English Porcelain (ENPO), Pearlwares (PEARL), English Brown stoneware 
(ENGS BRST), Nottinghamtype stonewares (NOTS), Transfer Printed wares (TPW), 
Mocha decorated yellow wares and refined white earthenware (REFW). These wares 
date from c. 17801900 and occur in contexts 606, 615, 1108, 4/03, 4/012, 7/008, 
7/025, 7/026, 11/040, 12/013, 12/020, 12/026, 12/031 and 13/015. Earlier post
medieval wares dating from c.15801800 occur in a different set of contexts (405, 
638, 809, 5/008, 7/030, 7/033, 7/037, 7/056, 7/059, 12/008,12/037, 13/008, 13/012, 
1429, 15010). These assemblages include Tin Glazed earthenwares (TGW), coarse 
and fine red earthenwares (PMR, PMFR, METS, PMSRY), imported Rhenish 
stoneware (SIEG, FREC),Surrey/Hampshire Whiteware; Tudor Green ware (TUDG) 
and Surrey Hampshire Borderware (BORDY). The medieval assemblage is comprised 
of small, abraded sherds in coarse cooking pot fabrics and the occasional finer glazed 
jug sherd. A variety of wares are present including Londontype ware (LOND), Late 
London ware (LLON), M Green ware (MG), South Hertfordshire greyware 
(SHER), Kingstontype ware (KING) and Hedingham ware (HEDI). Most of the 
cooking pot sherds are in a similar fabric which is not common to the London type 
series but is possibly a regional import from Essex. These wares fit within a date 
range of c.11501350 are found in contexts 612, 635, 805, 821, 4/04, 5/027 and ?
1822/822. Contexts 405, 1419 and 15010 contain assemblages of a mixed date.
Discussion
As most of the pottery in this assemblage occurs in small context groups its primary 
contribution to the site report is as a dating tool. Although the pottery ranges in date 
from c.1150 through to the 19th
 century it does not come from a continuous sequence 
of occupation on the site. The assemblage appears to be indicative of two phases, an 
�AOC ARCHAEOLOGY GROUP � NOVEMBER 200537
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
earlier and a later phase of postmedieval activity with the presence of some earlier 
medieval material. The small abraded nature of the earlier medieval pottery suggests 
that it could be the residual byproduct of manuring/night soiling. 
Potential
The most significant assemblages from this site might be those which contain earlier 
post medieval (16th
/17th 
century) ceramic groups. These particular wares appear to be 
found in distinct archaeological deposits which might relate to the late 16th
 to mid 19th 
century buildings identified on the site. These ceramic groups are also similar to the 
pottery found in previous evaluation work on the site. Beyond identifying these there 
is little potential for further work on this assemblage.

The Building Material
Naomi Crowley (AOC Archaeology)
Introduction
The excavation produced 140kg of building material and a number of tile, brick and 
stone samples, which were recorded by context fabric and form. Where possible the 
fabrics have been assigned Museum of London fabric codes, examples of which can 
be found in the Museum of London fabric reference collection.
Summary of Material
The assemblage consists mainly of postmedieval tile and brick, with a smaller 
amount of medieval tile. Table 1 contains a summary of the material with suggested 
date ranges for the material. Table 2 contains a list of the brick samples.
MEDIEVAL 
A number of contexts produced peg roof tile in Fabric 2271. This fabric was produced 
in large quantities in the London area from c.1180/1200 onwards until c.1500 when it 
was supplanted by a better made peg tile in Fabric 2276. Many of the fragments had 
mould sanding that was not as coarse as the fabric example, and occurred along with 
peg tile in Fabric 2276, perhaps suggesting that the tile in these contexts dates to 
nearer c.1500 and represents a transition between Fabric 2271 and 2276. Only 2 
fragments from Contexts 642 and 13/020 had splashed glaze on their surface, 
suggesting that they may earlier ie nearer c.1200, although these occur with peg tile in 
Fabric 2276 and so are probably reused. 
POSTMEDIEVAL
i) Roof tile
The majority of tile from the site was peg tile in Fabric 2276. This fabric supplanted 
Fabric 2271 as the common roofing material from the end of the 15th
 century and was 
manufactured until pantiles became the popular form of roofing from the late 17th
 or 
18th
 century. The site also produced fragments of pantile in Fabric 2279 from 
Contexts 12/023 and 13/012. 
ii) Floor tile
The site produced eight fragments of floor tile. These tiles are very worn but have 
traces of green or yellow glaze. They were probably imported from the Low Countries 
in the 15th
 or early 16th
 century. 
iii) Brick
�AOC ARCHAEOLOGY GROUP � NOVEMBER 200542
MOSELLE PLACE/WILLIAM STREET,TOTTENHAM� ARCHIVE REPORT
Many contexts contained fragments of bricks and a number of brick samples were 
taken from various features on the site, in Fabrics 3033, 3032 and 3035. Fabric 3033 
generally dates to the late 15th
 or 16th
 century onwards. Fabric 3032 appears after the 
Great Fire of London during the rebuilding of the late 17th
 century onwards. Fabric 
3035 is the distinctive yellow London Stock Brick which was manufactured during 
the late 18th
/19th
 century. One fragment of Fletton brick dates to the 20th
 century. 
STONE
The site produced a number of fragments of stone including Kentish Rag, Reigate 
Stone, slate, sandstone and chalk.
MORTAR, PLASTER AND DAUB
The site produced a small fragment of burnt daub from Context 15/010 and 8 
fragments of wall plaster from Context 827, consisting of a white sandy backing 
mortar, 2 moulded with a thin white plaster. 
Recommendations for Further Work
The building material should be correlated with the features and phases identified by 
the study of the stratified sequence. This w contribute to the interpretation of the 
function and appearance of the structures and their associated features, and w also 
provide date ranges for the various features in addition to or in the absence of other 
dating evidence.

Table 2. Summary of building material by context
Note on dating: The dating of tile in each context does <Node id="105155"/>not necessarily date the 
deposit<Node id="105188"/>. Building material from the demolition of buildings may have been dumped or 
reused in later structures. The dating refers to the manufacture date and the period of 
use of the material rather than the date of the deposit.

The Glass 
Cecily Cropper (AOC Archaeology)
Introduction
The assemblage comprised a total of 49 fragments of glass. Of these, 45% were bottle 
fragments, 37% were vessel fragments and the remaining 16 % were window glass. All 
window glass was from plain glazing. The earliest example is probably 16th
 century and a 
sequence of glazing/repairs is indicated from that date onwards to the 20th
 century. Notably, 
most of the window glass comes from Trench 7.
Results
All vessel and bottle glass is postmedieval or modern in date, ranging from a ?16th
 century 
moulddecorated beaker (14/029) to 19th
/20th
 century fragments. The bottles were 
predominantly for wine and range from an onion bottle (8/032) from the midto late 17th 
century to 19/20th
 century examples. One of them (12/008) may be a mid19th
 century 
Continental import. Overall the assemblage was small and fragmentary with few truly 
diagnostic pieces. <Node id="123732"/>None of the glass is of high quality or above ordinary status<Node id="123793"/>. 
FURTHER WORK
Due to the small size and fragmentary nature of the assemblage further work is limited. The 
distribution of the various categories of glass (window fragments mainly from Trench 7 and 
bottle glass from the highernumbered trenches 1113) may be indicative of different use
areas. Little light however can be shed upon social aspects of the site, however the date range 
suggests one that is longlived. 
No further work required.

Metal Artefact Assessment
AOC Archaeology
Introduction
A total of 15 iron and 7 copper alloy artefacts were recovered from various contexts during 
the excavation/evaluation. All have been stabilised, and no further work has been 
recommended.
Discussion
<Node id="125737"/>None of the metal artefacts can be considered as diagnostic either in terms of form or of date<Node id="125831"/>. 
A broad postmedieval date would certainly be applicable to all of the artefacts given the 
contexts from which they were recovered; there is no reason to suggest that any are from 
earlier periods. Items such as nails are prevalent, along with larger fittings, and a possible 
hook fragment from 13/017. The wound copper wire from 12/015 may be an ornament such 
as a bracelet, but is too fragmentary to identify definitively.
Conclusion
The assemblage broadly reflects what might be expected from a postmedieval site, 
particularly if processes of house demolition have occurred. 
Recommendations
There are no pieces which require Xradiography or further specialist analysis. A catalogue of 
the finds has been compiled, and no further work is required.

The Clay Pipe 
Tim Stevens (AOC Archaeology)
Introduction
During the investigations 25 fragments of clay tobacco pipe were recovered. Only two pieces 
were directly datable but these were recovered from unstratified contexts.
Bowls have been compared to the type series devised by Atkinson Oswald (1969) with 
additional reference to the DUA Clay Tobacco Pipe Type Series (Groves 1984). `Class' 
refers to the type series number as per Atkinson Oswald. All dates are approximate 
according to Atkinson Oswald. 
Discussion
All of the pieces obtained from securely stratified contexts were stem fragments and only 
broadly datable to the 17th
19th
 century period. The single exception was a 19th
 century 
mouthpiece fragment from context 13/020. Diagnostic bowl fragments from unstratified 
contexts attest to activity during the 17th
19th
 centuries, a conclusion also reached from more 
solid criteria than dating by the clay pipe assemblage.
Recommendations
The limited quality and quantity of the clay pipe assemblage means that the potential of the 
material is considered low. A catalogue of the artefacts has been compiled but no further 
work is necessary.

The Animal Bone 
AOC Archaeology
Introduction
A total of 160 pieces of animal bone were recovered from 21 stratified contexts and 2 
unstratified contexts. The material was subject to rapid visual assessment in order to 
determine the suitability of the assemblage for further analysis. The number of pieces per 
context are catalogued in Table 8.
Results 
The species represented include sheep/goat, dog, cat, bird, rodent and a possible badger. The 
majority of the pieces were bone, though some dentition, both herbivorous and carnivorous, 
was present. One ovicaprid horn core was also identified in context 15/010. One sheep/goat 
bone from context 8/005 displayed possible cutmarks but there were no other signs of 
butchery or dismemberment. One burnt piece was seen in context 6/043. Rodent bones were 
recovered from modern context 7/026. In addition, a number of pieces were not identifiable 
to species.
It should be noted that the population of the sample assemblage is somewhat skewed by the 
presence of 91 bones of a partial skeleton of a modern dog burial from an unstratified context 
in Trench 8.
Discussion
<Node id="130720"/>There is little meaningful data that can be gained from the animal bone assemblage<Node id="130802"/>, primarily 
because the majority of the contexts from which the material was recovered are demolition or 
construction contexts, rather than occupation or disposal contexts. Extrapolation of meat 
procurement and consumption strategies or discard policies, etc, are rendered meaningless on 
such a site. The single presence of a horn core and a cut bone do not in themselves signify on
site butchery, for example. The usual range of domesticated species represented at post
medieval sites are present, including dog and cat, along with wild animals such as rodents 
and a bird species.
Recommendations
The provenance and quality of the assemblage precludes further interpretation and no further 
work is recommended.

Summary
A total of nine artefacts were recovered from the site and registered as small finds. Of these 
only four justify a slightly expanded description above the level recorded in the catalogue 
(Table 9):
SF #1 Copper alloy token. 26mm diam. Low Countries `Vive le Roi' variety. Dated to 15th 
century or slightly later.
SF #4 Copper alloy coin. 28mm diam. British George III 1806 one penny.
SF #5 Copper alloy coin. 28mm diam. British George III. Poor condition (very worn). 
Possibly one penny. Dated 17601820.
SF #9 Glass. 3mm diam by 2mm. Small reddishpurple bead
Recommendations
As the small finds are to continue to be stored in a stable humiditycontrolled environment 
and a catalogue has been compiled, no further work is required on this assemblage.

The Moulded Plaster

Introduction
Numerous pieces of plaster have been examined and recorded; details have been entered into 
an Excel database, using the reference numbers attached to the pieces where applicable: a few 
large pieces and a number of fragments have no such numbers. The accompanying paperwork 
from AOC lists pieces with the numbers P1 and all numbers from P29 to P100. Not all these 
appear in the Excel database but it seems likely that some of the pieces examined have lost 
their numbers, either by abrasion or by them breaking off. All the pieces are from a single 
context, `the backf of a cellar ... consisting of debris created during the Period 8 demolition 
of the house during the 19th
 century': in the paperwork this context is called 11/008; on the 
pieces themselves and on the boxes it is called 1108; the latter has been followed in the Excel 
database.
Mouldings and Ornament
The fragments include several of unrecognisable form, but the numbered pieces and some 
others are mostly recognisable. Most come from runs which would have decorated a fretted 
ceiling. A standard moulding � that is, one which is common to numerous pieces � was 
recognised and this term has been used, where appropriate, in the database. It consists of a 
bead moulding bordering the flat face of the run with, on its outer side � that is, on the edge 
of the run � a square quirk and a cavetto moulding. The flat faces are decorated with various 
floral motifs, mostly of a running design. These include buglelike flowers, what appear to be 
bunches of grapes, heraldic roses � one surrounded by overlapping discs, possibly 
representing further petals � smaller flowers, and a podlike element. Often leaves and in one 
case buds are also depicted, as, occasionally, are much finer tendrils. Most of the runs appear 
to be straight but some show a slight curvature, indicating that both straight and curved runs 
were employed in the design of the fretted ceiling. This was normal in such ceilings. Other 
pieces, all fragmentary (P29, P51, P69, P80, and six unnumbered fragments), show a cyma 
recta moulding, in one case with an adjoining fillet and cavetto: it is likely that all the cyma 
recta pieces were similar. These larger mouldings may have formed part of a coving at the 
junction of walls and ceiling rather than the edges of fret runs. This may be the case too with 
three pieces (P35, P64, P73) which have egganddart ornament within a cavetto. 
One piece (P79) is a large floral boss, unfortunately in poor condition. A few other 
pieces are definitely or probably from similar bosses. Two rather crudely formed curved 
pieces with scored decoration (P53 and P65) may be from bosses of a different form. The 
bosses would have hung as pendants from the ceiling, either at the intersections of runs or at 
the centres of the panels defined by them.
Also present are some human heads. Pieces P58 and P59 conjoin to form a single 
(incomplete) piece. The head is modelled in the round and is approximately oval in shape. 
The eyes are quite wide; the nose has been lost and only a little of the mouth remains. The 
head is wearing a hat, with, apparently, a sidelock of hair protruding from it on each side. 
The head is contained within a concave surface which has part of a frame scored into the

plaster. Piece P62 is basically similar but in slightly better condition. The head has hair and 
no hat; a strange winglike element protrudes from behind the sidelock on the figure's left 
(the corresponding righthand side is missing). There is a ruff or collar around the neck. 
Again the head is within a concave curve and has a frame partly moulded and partly scored. 
Piece P61 is a fragment of the lower part of one side of a similar head. The heads are not 
large, the faces measuring some 75 mm long by 70 mm broad. It is possible that the heads, 
against the concave surfaces, decorated a coving at the junction of walls and ceiling, but it is 
perhaps more probable that they come from an elaborate plaster chimneypiece, like several 
surviving examples, for instance at Loseley, Surrey (c.1565) and at Boston Manor, Brentford, 
Middx (c.1623).1
Date
Fretted ceilings using plaster runs like those from Moselle Place were popular � for those 
who could afford them � in late Elizabethan and Jacobean times. In the early 18th
 century, 
Richard Neve observed that `plaister'd Ceilings are much used in England, beyond all other 
Countreys'.2
 They did indeed become an English speciality, originating in woodenribbed 
ceilings with square, rectangular, and polygonal panels. Once plaster was adopted, ribs could 
more easily be made sinuous, and circles, ovals, and other curves were added to the 
rectilinear forms. Sir Henry Wotton (1568�1639) considered `the graceful fretting of roofs [= 
ceilings]' to be the chief of the plastic arts.3
 It certainly increased the status of plasterers, 
whose work hitherto had typically been of a more banausic character � daubing walls, the 
insides of chimney flues and garderobe chutes, and the like. London examples of such 
ceilings exist at Canonbury House, Islington (1570�1600), 17 Fleet Street (c1611), and 
elsewhere.4
 Other notable instances include Broughton Castle, Oxon (1599), Stockton House, 
Wilts (c1600), the Combination Room at St John's College, Cambridge (c1600), Bramsh 
House, Hants (1605�12), Knole, Kent (c1607); and Bolsover Castle, Derbys (1620s). A date 
in the late 16th or early 17th
 century is therefore likely for the Moselle Place pieces. A similar 
date applies to the heads, whether they were used as part of such a ceiling or in a 
chimneypiece.
Working and Fixing the Plaster
Simple ribbing could be formed by running a template along a block of wet plaster.5
 More 
complex forms would have to be moulded or even formed freehand. But often the simpler 
forms too were moulded. This was done using wooden moulds coated with nut oil to prevent 
the plaster from adhering to them. The different methods of shaping could be carried out in 
situ or, more conveniently, at a moulder's bench. In the latter case, the finished pieces were 
inserted into their correct positions, and temporarily propped in place, whilst the plain plaster 
of the ceiling was st wet.
The plaster would for the most part be applied to laths nailed to the ceiling beams. 
Several of the pieces show the impressions of laths in their rear faces. Many are incomplete 
but others show lath widths ranging from 23 mm to 32 mm with a median of 27 mm, 
although one incomplete example appears to have been greater than 40 mm. Larger pieces 
might be built up on a timber armature, providing more strength than solid blocks of plaster. 
Four pieces (P35, P80, and two unnumbered pieces) show the impressions of such timbers: 
they show ovolo, cyma recta, or egganddart mouldings. The fragment of pendant boss P65 
has a metal rod some 7 mm in diameter embedded in it: this would have enabled a secure �

and safe � fixing of the boss to a ceiling beam.
Paint
The Moselle Place plaster is offwhite and is fairly coarse with a number of small stones in it. 
Plaster can have a dull look and was often limewashed to give a creamy appearance. For a 
much richer effect, the salient components � ribs, bosses, or pendants � might be painted and/
or gilded. The `Great Gallery' at Lord Burleigh's now lost Theobalds in Hertfordshire, for 
example, rebuilt in the 1570s, had `a frett seelinge with Divers pendents Roses and 
flowerdeleuces [fleursdelys], painted and gilded'.6
 Examples have been found during 
excavations by MoLAS at Somerset House, probably the work of the Master Plasterer, James 
Lee (or Leigh, fl.1611�15).7
 Such ceilings would have had a coruscating effect, especially by 
flickering candlelight, giving point to Hamlet's metaphor for the sky: `this majestical roof 
fretted with golden fire'.8
 Only two pieces from Moselle Place, however, show paint: piece 
P69 has pink paint on its cyma recta and possible honeysuckle moulding whilst piece P38 is a 
flat section painted brown and pink with a tendril pattern in black: probably the brown/pink 
was originally a brighter red. There is no evidence of gilding.
